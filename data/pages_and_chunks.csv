16,"FOREWORD Since the second edition of this book was published in 2010, business analysis has  continued to grow, evolve and gain momentum as a profession. Increasingly, the  business analysis practice, and the capability it offers to organisations, is viewed as  a strategic asset that drives a thorough understanding of the business environment  and of business problems. As a result, it is seen as a vital resource that enables the  successful implementation of valuable business change. Business analysis practitioners are finding their profession has gained increased  recognition, both within their organisations and beyond. The idea of community has  grown and grown; whether that is external BA communities, internal ‘communities  of practice’ or virtual communities.",773,113,193.25
16,"However, we must not stand still. It was difficult  to imagine how the previous edition could have been improved, yet the authors have  certainly done so. This edition brings many welcome additions. The CMMI model for Business Analysis is of particular interest as it brings the idea  of a framework of maturity, and I suspect many BA practices will find this useful as  a yardstick. Having a centrally defined and well-researched framework will be of  significant benefit.",473,77,118.25
16,"There’s more of an Agile flavour throughout the book. Previous versions of the book have  been completely compatible with an Agile approach but in this version it is mentioned  much more explicitly. This highlights that business analysis is equally crucial on Agile,  iterative and linear waterfall projects. The addition of a new expanded chapter which focuses on defining the solution will be of  interest to many readers too. The chapter includes an extended section on gap analysis  and, notably, a section on business architecture principles and techniques.",562,87,140.5
16,"This helps  position business analysis and architecture as complementary skill sets. This book has always been at the heart of the business analysis profession. This edition  shows that the international BA community is pushing forward, evolving and keeping  with the times. I have no doubt that the book will continue to be an extremely useful  resource that will be referenced by new and experienced practitioners alike.

31,"1 WHAT IS BUSINESS ANALYSIS? Debra Paul INTRODUCTION This is a book about Business Analysis, a discipline that has evolved over the last two  decades and has the potential to offer great benefit to organisations by ensuring that  there is alignment between business needs and business change solutions. Many  solutions involve the development of new or enhanced information systems but this  is unlikely to be the extent of the business change, and it is probable that solutions  will have a broader scope incorporating changes to areas such as business processes  and job roles. The reason for producing this book is to provide guidance about  business analysis that reflects the breadth of the role and the range of techniques  used. While many organisations employ business analysts, there persists a lack of  clarity about what the role really involves and this often creates more questions  than answers.",909,145,227.25
31,"What do business analysts do? What skills do they require? How do  they add value to organisations? Recognition in the broader business community is  also an issue with many misconceptions regarding business analysis and a lack of  appreciation of the contribution business analysts might make. Also, in the absence  of a standard definition of business analysis and a standard set of business analysis  activities, problems have arisen:  yy Organisations have introduced business analysis to make sure that business  needs are paramount when new IT systems are introduced.",573,87,143.25
31,"However,  recognising the importance of this in principle is easier than ensuring that it  is achieved. Many business analysts still report a drive towards documenting  requirements without a clear understanding of the desired business out­ comes. yy Some business analysts were previously experienced IT systems analysts and  proved less comfortable considering the business requirements and the range  of potential solutions that would meet the requirements. yy Many business analysts have a business background and have a limited  understanding of IT and how software is developed. While knowledge of the  business is invaluable for business analysts, problems can occur where  IT forms part of the business solution and the analyst has insufficient  understanding of IT.",774,114,193.5
31,"This may cause communication difficulties with the  developers and could result in failure to ensure that there is an integrated  view of the business and IT system.  yy Some business analysts, as they have gained in experience and knowledge,  have felt that they could offer beneficial advice to their organisations but a  1",325,53,81.25
32,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS 	 lack of understanding of the role, and a focus on ensuring governance rather  than understanding the need, has caused organisations to reject or ignore  this advice. This chapter examines business analysis as a specialist profession and considers how  we might better define the business analyst role. In Chapter 4 we describe a process  model for business analysis and an overview of two aspects: how business analysis is  carried out and the key techniques to be used at each stage. Much of this book provides  guidance on how the various stages in the business analysis process model may be  carried out. Business analysis work is well defined where there are standard techniques  that have been used in projects for many years.",751,122,187.75
32,"In fact, many of these techniques have  been in use for far longer than the business analyst role has been in existence. We  describe numerous techniques in this book that we feel should be within any business  analyst’s toolkit, and place them within the overall process model. Our aim is to help  business analysts carry out their work, improve the quality of business analysis within  organisations and, as a result, help organisations to adopt business improvements that  will ensure business success.  THE ORIGINS OF BUSINESS ANALYSIS Developments in IT have enabled organisations to create information systems that  have improved business operations and management decision-making. In the past,  this has been the focus of IT departments.",744,115,186.0
32,"However, as business operations have  changed, the emphasis has moved on to the development of new services and  products. The questions we need to ask now are – ‘What can IT do to exploit business  opportunities and enhance the portfolio of products and services?’ and ‘What needs  to change in the organisation if the benefits from a new or enhanced IT system are to  be realised?’ Technology has enabled new business models to be implemented through more  flexible communication mechanisms that allow organisations to reach out to the  customer, connect their systems with those of their suppliers and support global  operations. The use of IT has also created opportunities for organisations to focus  on their core processes and competencies without the distraction of the peripheral  areas of business where they do not have specialist skills.",849,135,212.25
32,"These days, the absence of  good information systems would prevent an organisation from developing significant  competitive advantage and new organisations can gain considerable market share  by investing in an IT architecture that supports service delivery and business  growth. Yet for many years there has been a growing dissatisfaction in businesses  with the support provided by IT. This has been accompanied by a recognition by  senior management that IT investment often fails to deliver the required business  benefit. In short, the technology enables the development of information systems  but these rarely meet the requirements of the business or deliver the service that  will bring competitive advantage to the organisation. The Financial Times (Mance  2013) reported that this situation applies to all sectors, with IT projects continuing  to overrun their budgets by significant amounts and poor communication between  business and technical experts remaining problematic.",987,142,246.75

33,"WHAT IS BUSINESS ANALYSIS? THE DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS ANALYSIS The impact of outsourcing In a drive to reduce costs, and sometimes in recognition of a lack of IT expertise  at senior management level, many organisations have outsourced their IT services  rather than employ their own internal IT staff. They have handed much of this work  to specialist IT service providers. This approach has been based upon the belief that  specialist providers, often working in countries where costs are lower than the UK,  will be able to deliver higher quality at lower cost. So, in organisations which have  outsourced their IT function, the IT systems are designed, constructed and delivered  using staff employed by an external supplier.",730,116,182.5
33,"This undoubtedly has advantages for  both the organisation purchasing the services and the specialist supplier. The latter  gains an additional customer and the opportunity to increase turnover and make  profit from the contractual arrangement. The customer organisation is no longer  concerned with all staffing, infrastructure and support issues and instead pays the  specialist provider for delivery of the required service. In theory this approach has  much to recommend it but, as is usually the case, the limitations begin to emerge  once the arrangement has been implemented, particularly in the areas of supplier  management and communication of requirements. The issues relating to supplier  management are not the subject of this book, and would require a book in their  own right.",791,119,197.75
33,"However, we are concerned with the issue of communication between the  business and the outsourced development team. The communication and clarification  of requirements is key to ensuring the success of any IT system development but an  outsourcing arrangement often complicates the communication process, particularly  where there is geographical distance between the developers and the business. We  need to ask ourselves how well do the business and technical groups understand  each other and is the communication sufficiently frequent and open? Communication  breakdowns usually result in the delivered IT systems failing to provide the required  level of support for the business.  The outsourcing business model has undoubtedly been a catalyst for the development  of the business analysis function as more and more organisations recognise the  importance of business representation during the development and implementation  of IT systems.",948,135,237.0
33,"Competitive advantage of using IT A parallel development that has helped to increase the profile of business analysis  and define the business analyst role, has been the growing recognition that three  factors need to be present in order for the IT systems to deliver competitive  advantage. First, the needs of the business must drive the development of the IT  systems; second, the implementation of an IT system must be accompanied by the  necessary business changes and third, the requirements for IT systems must be  defined with rigour and accuracy. The traditional systems analyst role operated  primarily in the last area; today’s business challenges require all three areas to be  addressed.  3",703,111,175.75
34,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Successful business change During the last few years, organisations have adopted a broader view – from IT projects  to business change programmes. Within these programmes, there has been recognition  of the need for roles and skill sets that enable the successful delivery of business change  initiatives. The roles of the programme manager and change manager are well defined,  with a clear statement of their scope and focus within the business change lifecycle.  However, we now need to ensure that the business analyst role – one that uncovers  the root causes of problems, identifies the issues to be addressed and ensures any  solution will align with business needs – has a similar level of definition and recognition.  Figure 1.1 shows a typical business change lifecycle.",798,126,199.5
34," Figure 1.1  The business change lifecycle Figure 1.1 The early part of the business change lifecycle – Alignment and Definition – is concerned  with the analysis of the organisation, its business needs and requirements in order  to determine new ways of working that will improve the organisation’s efficiency and  effectiveness. Later business change activities are concerned with change design and  development, business acceptance testing and, post implementation, benefits review  and realisation. Clearly, extensive analysis is required throughout the lifecycle if the  changes are to be successful in order to deliver the desired benefits. The analysis  work falls within the remit of business analysis yet, in many organisations, a coherent  approach to business change, that includes business analysts in the business change  lifecycle, is still awaited. As a result, it is often the case that the definition of the business  needs and the requirements to ensure they are met are often unclear or not aligned.",1018,154,254.5

35,"WHAT IS BUSINESS ANALYSIS? too often the focus almost from the outset is on the solution rather than understanding  what problem we are trying to address. The lack of clarity and alignment can result in  the development or adoption of changes that fail to deliver business benefits and waste  investment funds.  The importance of the business analyst The delivery of predicted business benefits, promised from the implementation of IT,  has proved to be extremely difficult, with the outsourcing of IT services serving to add  complication to already complex situations. The potential exists for organisations to  implement information systems that yield competitive advantage and yet this often  appears to be just out of reach.",729,113,182.25
35,"Organisations also want help in finding potential  solutions to business issues and opportunities, sometimes where IT may not prove to be  the answer, but it has become apparent that this requires a new set of skills to support  business managers in achieving this. These factors have led directly to the development  of the business analyst role. Having identified the relevance of the business analyst role, we now need to recognise  the potential this can offer, particularly in a global economic environment where budgets  are limited and waste of financial resources unacceptable. The importance of using  investment funds wisely and delivering the business benefits predicted for business  change initiatives, has becoming increasingly necessary to the survival of organisations. Business analysts as internal consultants Many organisations use external consultants to provide expert advice throughout the  business change lifecycle.",939,136,234.75
35,"The reasons are clear – they can be employed to deal with  a specific issue on an ‘as-needed basis’, they bring a broader business perspective  and can provide a dispassionate, objective view of the company. On the other hand, the  use of external consultants is often criticised, across all sectors, because of the lack of  accountability and the absence of any transfer of skills from the external consultants  to internal staff. Cost is also a key issue. Consultancy firms often charge daily fee rates  that are considerably higher than the charge levied for an internal analyst and whilst  the firms may provide consultants with a broad range of expertise steeped in best  practice, this is not always guaranteed. The experiences gained from using external  consultants have also played a part in the development of the internal business analysis  role.",857,139,214.25
35,"Many business analysts have argued that they can provide the services offered  by external consultants and can, in effect, operate as internal consultants. Reasons for  using internal business analysts as consultants, apart from lower costs, include speed  (internal consultants do not have to spend time learning about the organisation) and  the retention of knowledge within the organisation. These factors have been recognised  as particularly important for projects where the objectives concern the achievement  of business benefit through the use of IT and where IT is a prime enabler of business  change. As a result, while external consultants are used for many business purposes,  the majority of business analysts are employed by their organisations. These analysts  may lack an external viewpoint but they are knowledgeable about the business  domain and crucially will have to live with the impact of the actions they recommend.",939,142,234.75
35," Consequently, there have been increasing numbers of business analysts working as  internal consultants over the last decade. 5",127,18,31.75
36,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS THE SCOPE OF BUSINESS ANALYSIS WORK A major issue for business analysts is the definition of the business analyst role.  Discussions with several hundred business analysts, across a range of business forums,  have established that business analysis roles do not always accurately represent the  range of responsibilities that business analysts are capable of fulfilling.  The range of analysis activities One way in which we can consider the business analyst role is to examine the potential  extent of analysis work. Figure 1.2 shows three areas that we might consider to be  within the province of the business analyst. There are always unclear aspects where  the three areas overlap.",704,109,176.0
36,"For example, consultants may specialise in strategic analysis  but also get involved in business process redesign to make a reality of their strategies,  and good systems analysts have always understood the need to understand the overall  business context of the systems they are developing. However, it is useful to examine  them separately in order to consider their relevance to the business analyst role.  Figure 1.2  The potential range of the business analyst role Figure 1.2 Strategic analysis and definition Strategic analysis and definition is typically the work of senior management, often  supported by strategy consultants. Some business analysts may be required to  undertake strategic analysis and identify business transformation actions, but it is  more likely that they will have a role to play in supporting this activity. In the main,  we believe that strategic analysis is mostly outside the remit of business analysis.",939,143,234.75
36,"We  would, however, expect business analysts to have access to information about their  organisation’s business strategy and be able to understand it, as their work will need  to support the execution of this strategy. Business analysts often have to recommend  and design the tactics that will deliver the business objectives and strategy, typically  the process and IT system solutions. Hence, it is vital that they are able to work within  the strategic business context. It may also be the case that some business analyst roles  will require strategic level thinking. The use of IT to enable business improvements  and the opportunities presented by technology will need to be considered during any  strategy analysis and the business analysts are the specialist team that should be able  to advise on the use of technology to drive business change.",853,136,213.25
36,"Given these issues, we feel  that, while strategic analysis work is not core to business analysis, business analysts  6",119,19,29.75
37,"WHAT IS BUSINESS ANALYSIS? will need a good understanding of how strategy is developed and the impact upon the  work of the IT and business change functions. In view of this, Chapter 3 explores a range  of strategic analysis techniques and provides an overview of the strategic planning  process.  IT systems analysis At the other end of our model, there is the traditional IT discipline called systems  analysis. The systems analyst role has been in existence for over 40 years although  the term ‘systems analyst’ tends to be used less often these days.",555,93,138.75
37,"Systems analysts  are responsible for analysing and specifying the IT system requirements in sufficient  detail to provide a basis for the evaluation of software packages or the development of  a bespoke IT system. Typically, systems analysis work involves the use of techniques  such as data modelling and process or function modelling. This work is focused on  describing the software requirements, and so the products of systems analysis define  exactly what data the IT system will record, the processing that will be applied to that  data and how the user interface will operate. Some organisations consider this work  to be of such a technical nature that they perceive it to be completely outside the  province of the business analyst. They have identified that modelling process and data  requirements for the IT system is not part of the role of the business analyst and have  separated the business analysis and IT teams into different departments, expecting  the IT department to carry out the detailed IT systems modelling and specification.",1053,167,263.25
37," Other organisations differentiate between IT business analysts and ‘business’ business  analysts, with those in IT often performing a role more akin to that of a systems  analyst. In order to do this, the business analysts need a detailed understanding  of IT systems and how they operate, and must be able to use the approaches and  modelling techniques that fell historically within the remit of the system analyst role.  The essential difference here is that a business analyst is responsible for considering  a range of business options to address a particular problem or opportunity; on  the other hand an IT business analyst, or systems analyst, works within a defined  scope and considers options for the IT solution. In some organisations, there is little  divide between the business analysts and the IT team. In these cases the business  analysts work closely with the IT developers and include the definition of IT system  requirements as a key part of their role.",976,158,244.0
37,"This is particularly the case where an Agile  approach has been adopted for a software development project; the business analyst  will work closely with the end users and development team to clarify the detailed  requirements as they evolve during the development process.  Business analysis If the two analysis disciplines described above define the limits of analysis work, the  gap in the middle is straddled by business analysis. This is reflected in Figure 1.2 which  highlights the potential scope and extent of business analysis work. Business analysts  will usually be required to investigate a business system where improvements are  required but the range and focus of those improvements can vary considerably.  yy It may be that the analysts are asked to resolve a localised business issue.",801,125,200.25
37,"In  such a case, they would need to recommend actions that would overcome a  problem or achieve business benefits.  7",117,20,29.25
38,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS yy Perhaps it is more likely that the study is broader than this and requires  investigation into several issues, or perhaps ideas, regarding increased efficiency  or effectiveness. This work would necessitate extensive and detailed analysis  of the business area. The analysts would need to make recommendations for  business changes and these would need to be supported by a rigorous business  case.  yy Another possibility is that the business analyst is asked to focus specifically on  enhancing or replacing an existing IT system in line with business requirements.  In this case the analyst would deliver a requirements document defining what  the business requires the IT system to provide.",715,109,178.75
38,"This document may define the  requirements in detail or may be at a more overview level, depending upon the  approach to the system development. Where an Agile approach is to be used,  the business analyst may also be involved in prioritising the requirements and  identifying those to be input into the next development iteration.  yy More senior business analysts may be involved in working cross-functionally,  taking a value delivery approach. This work is likely to require analysis of a  workstream comprising various activities and systems. In this case, the analyst  will need to have wide-ranging skills not only in analysis but also in stakeholder  relationship management, and they will also require extensive business domain  knowledge.",748,115,187.0
38,"Whichever situation applies, the study usually begins with the analyst gaining an  understanding of the business situation in hand. A problem may have been defined in  very specific terms, and a possible solution identified, but in practice it is rare that this  turns out to be the entire problem and it is even less the case that any proposed solution  addresses all of the issues. More commonly, there is a more general set of problems  that require a broad focus and in-depth investigation. Sometimes, the first step is to  clarify the problem to be solved as, without this, any analysis could be examining the  wrong area and, as a result, identifying unhelpful solutions. For any changes to succeed  the business analyst needs to consider all aspects, for example, what processes, IT  systems, job roles, skills and other resources will be needed to improve the situation.",878,145,219.5
38,"In  such situations, techniques such as stakeholder analysis, business process modelling  and requirements engineering may all be required in order to identify the actions  required to improve the business system. These three topics are the subject of later  chapters in this book. Realising business benefits Analysing business situations, and identifying areas for business improvement, is only  part of the process; the analyst may also be required to help develop a business case in  order to justify the required level of investment and ensure any risks are considered. One  of the key elements of the business case will be the identification and, where relevant, the  quantification of the business benefits. Organisations are placing increasing emphasis  upon ensuring that there is a rigorous business case to justify the expenditure on  business improvement projects.",876,131,219.0
38,"However, defining the business case is only part of the  picture – the focus on the management and realisation of these business benefits, once  the solution has been delivered, is also growing. This is largely because organisations  have limited funds for investment and need to ensure that they are spent wisely. There  has been a long history of failure to assess whether or not business benefits have been  8",412,69,103.0
39,"WHAT IS BUSINESS ANALYSIS? realised from change projects but this is becoming increasingly unacceptable as the  financial pressures mount on organisations and the calls for transparency grow. The  business analyst will not be the only role involved in this work. However, ensuring that  changes are assessed in terms of the impact upon the business case and, at a later  point, supporting the assessment of whether or not predicted business benefits have  been realised, is a key element of the role. Taking a holistic approach There appears to be universal agreement that business analysis requires the application  of a holistic approach.",640,100,160.0
39,"Although the business analyst performs a key role in supporting  management’s exploitation of IT to obtain business benefit, this has to be within the  context of the entire business system. Hence, all aspects of the operational business  system need to be analysed if all of the opportunities for business improvement are to  be uncovered. The POPIT model in Figure 1.3 shows the different views that must be  considered when identifying areas for improving the business system. Figure 1.3  The POPIT model showing the views of a business system Figure 1.3 This model shows us the different aspects, and the correspondences between them,  that business analysts need to consider when analysing a business system. For each  area, we might consider the following: yy The processes – are they well defined and communicated?",821,131,205.25
39,Is there good IT  support or are there several ‘work-arounds’ in existence? Does the process  require documents to be passed around the organisation unnecessarily? Is  there the potential for delays or the introduction of errors? yy The people – do they have the required skills for the job? How motivated are  they?,316,52,79.0
39,Do they understand the business objectives that they need to support? yy The organisation – is there a supportive management style? Are jobs and  responsibilities well defined? Is there collaborative cross-functional working? 9,227,33,56.75
40,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS yy The information – do the staff have the information to conduct their work  effectively? Are managers able to make decisions based on accurate and timely  information? yy The technology – do the systems support the business as required? Do they  provide the information needed to run the organisation? We need to examine and understand all of these areas to uncover where problems lie  and what improvements might be possible, if the business system is to become more  effective.",499,81,124.75
40,"Taking a holistic view is vital as this ensures not only that all of the aspects  are considered but also the linkages between them. It is often the case that the focus  of a business analysis or business change study is primarily on the processes and the  IT support. However, even if we have the most efficient processes with high standards  of IT support, problems will persist if issues with staffing, such as skills shortages, or  the organisation, such as management style, have not also been addressed. It is vital that the business analyst is aware of the broader aspects relating to business  situations such as the culture of the organisation and its impact on the people and  the working practices. The adoption of a holistic approach will help ensure that these  aspects are included in the analysis of the situation.",829,141,207.25
40,"Business analysis places an emphasis on improving the operation of the entire business  system. This means that, while technology is viewed as a factor that could enable  improvements to the business operations, other possibilities are also considered. The  focus should be on business improvement, rather than on the use of automation per  se, resulting in recommendations that improve the business. Typically, these include  the use of IT but this is not necessarily the case. There may be situations where a  short-term non-IT solution is both helpful and cost-effective.",574,88,143.5
40,"For example, a problem  may be overcome by developing internal standards or training members of staff.  These solutions may be superseded by longer term, possibly more costly, solutions,  but the focus on the business has ensured that the immediate needs have been met.  Once urgent issues have been addressed, the longer term solutions can be considered  more thoroughly. It is important that our focus as business analysts is on identifying  opportunities for improvement with regard to the needs of the particular situation. If we  do this, we can recommend changes that will help deliver real business improvements  and ensure that funds are invested prudently.",665,104,166.25
40,"Agile systems development Agile is a software development approach which emerged in the late 1990s in the wake  of approaches such as Rapid Application Development (RAD) and the Dynamic System  Development Method (DSDM). The use of such approaches evolved as a reaction to  the linear waterfall lifecycle, with its emphasis on completing a stage before moving  on to the next stage. The Agile philosophy is to deliver software increments early and  to elaborate requirements using approaches such as prototyping. The Agile Manifesto  stated: 10",544,84,136.0
41,"WHAT IS BUSINESS ANALYSIS? We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others  do it. Through this work we have come to value: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools Working software over comprehensive documentation Customer collaboration over contract negotiation Responding to change over following a plan That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the  left more. So, what does this mean for the business analyst? In essence, where a business analyst  is working on a project where an Agile software development approach has been  adopted, the analyst will be involved in supporting the business users in clarifying,  elaborating and prioritising the requirements during the development process.",782,122,195.5
41,"While  some early business analysis work will have been required to uncover the problems to  be addressed and define the business requirements, at a solution level the more detailed  requirements will be elaborated during timeboxed iterations where collaborative  teams comprising users, analysts and developers work together to develop part of  the software required product. The business analyst brings domain expertise and  analytical ability to the development team, assisting the users by assessing the impact  of proposed functionality in the light of the strategic business context. The role of the  business analyst in an Agile environment is explored further in Chapters 10 and 13. Supporting business change It is often commented that, even when the business analysts have defined excellent  solutions that have been well-designed and developed, business improvement initiatives  can fail during implementation. The business analyst may be required to support the  implementation of the business changes.",1014,147,253.5
41,"Figure 1.3 also offers an effective structure for  identifying the range of areas to be considered. One aspect may concern the business  acceptance testing – a vital element if business changes are to be implemented smoothly.  The business analyst’s involvement in business acceptance testing can include work  such as developing test scenarios and working with the business users as they apply the  scenarios to their new processes and systems. Further, the implementation of business  change may require extensive support from the business analysts, including tasks such as: yy writing procedure manuals and user guides; yy training business staff in the use of the new processes and IT systems; yy defining job roles and writing job role descriptions; yy providing ongoing support as the business staff begin to adopt the new,  unfamiliar, approaches. 11",857,133,214.25
42,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS The role of the business analyst throughout the change lifecycle is explored further in  Chapter 14. THE ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF A BUSINESS ANALYST So where does this leave us in defining the role and responsibilities of a business  analyst? Although there are different role definitions, depending upon the organisation,  there does seem to be an area of common ground where most business analysts work.  These core responsibilities are: yy Investigate business systems taking a holistic view of the situation; this  may include examining elements of the organisation structures and staff  development issues as well as current processes and IT systems. yy Evaluate actions to improve the operation of a business system.",744,114,186.0
42,"Again, this  may require an examination of organisational structure and staff development  needs, to ensure that they are in line with any proposed process redesign and  IT system development. yy Document the business requirements for the IT system support using  appropriate documentation standards. yy Elaborate requirements, in support of the business users, during evolutionary  system development. In line with this, we believe the core business analyst role should be defined as: An advisory role which has the responsibility for investigating and analysing business  situations, identifying and evaluating options for improving business systems,  elaborating and defining requirements, and ensuring the effective implementation  and use of information systems in line with the needs of the business. Some business analysis roles extend into other areas, possibly the strategic analysis or  systems analysis activities described above.",941,132,235.25
42,"This may be where business analysts are  in a more senior role or choose to specialise. These areas are: yy Strategy implementation – here the business analysts work closely with senior  management to help define the most effective business system to implement  elements of the business strategy. yy Business case production – more senior business analysts usually do this,  typically with assistance from Finance specialists. yy Benefits realisation – the business analysts carry out post-implementation  reviews, examine the benefits defined in the business case and evaluate  whether or not the benefits have been achieved. Actions to achieve the business  benefits are also identified and sometimes carried out by the business analysts.",740,111,185.0
42,yy Specification of IT requirements – typically using standard modelling  techniques such as data modelling or use case modelling. 12,133,20,33.25
43,"WHAT IS BUSINESS ANALYSIS? The definition of the business analyst role may be expanded by considering the rationale  for business analysis. The rationale seeks to explain why business analysis is so  important for organisations in today’s business world and imposes responsibilities that  business analysts must recognise and accept. The rationale for business analysis is: yy Root causes not symptoms ß To distinguish between the symptoms of problems and the root causes ß To investigate and address the root causes of business problems ß To consider the holistic view yy Business improvement not IT change ß To recognise that IT systems should enable business opportunity or problem  resolution ß To analyse opportunities for business improvement ß To enable business agility yy Options not solutions ß To challenge pre-determined solutions ß To identify and evaluate options for meeting business needs yy Feasible, contributing requirements not meeting all requests ß To be aware of financial and timescale constraints ß To identify requirements that are not feasible and do not contribute to  business objectives ß To evaluate stated requirements against business needs and constraints yy The entire business change lifecycle not just requirements definition ß To analyse business situations ß To support the effective development, testing, deployment and post- implementation review of solutions ß To support the management and realisation of business benefits yy Negotiation not avoidance ß To recognise conflicting stakeholder views and requirements ß To negotiate conflicts between stakeholders THE BUSINESS ANALYSIS MATURITY MODEL As the Business Analysis Practice has developed within organisations, a progression for  business analysis itself has emerged reflecting this development. The Business Analysis  Maturity ModelTM (BAMM) shown in Figure 1.4 was developed by Assist Knowledge  Development Ltd to represent the development and maturity of business analysis.",1992,288,498.0

This model reflects discussions with several hundred, if not thousands, of business  analysts working for numerous organisations across the UK, Europe and beyond. These  business analysts have come from different backgrounds – some from IT, many from  business areas – and have brought different skills and knowledge to their business  analysis teams. The BAMM uses two axes: the scope of the work allocated to the  business analyst and the authority level of the business analyst. The scope may be very  specific if an initial study has identified the required course of action and the analyst  now needs to explore and define solution in greater detail. Alternatively, the scope  may have been defined at only an overview level, or may be very ambiguous, with the  business analyst having to carry out detailed investigation to uncover the issues before  the options can be explored.",1047,164,261.75
44,"The level of authority of the business analyst can also vary  considerably, from a limited level of authority to the ability to influence and guide at  senior management level. The BAMM shows three levels of maturity during the development of business analysis.  The first level is where the business analysis work is concerned with defining the  requirements for an IT system improvement. At this level, the scope is likely to be  well-defined and the level of authority limited to the project on which the business  analyst works. The next level is where the business analysis work has moved beyond  a specific IT development so that the analysts work cross-functionally to improve the  business processes that give rise to the requirements.",743,120,185.75
44,"The third level is where the  scope and authority of the analysts are at their greatest. Here, the business analysis  work is concerned with improving the business and working with senior management  to support the delivery of value to customers.  These levels of maturity apply to three perspectives on business analysis: the  individual analysts, the business analysis community within an organisation, and the  14",416,64,104.0

At each level, the application of techniques  and skills, the use of standards, and the evaluation of the work through measures,  can vary considerably.

In doing this, the  analysts may initially have to develop their own process and standards for each piece  of work.

The factors that support professionalism in business  analysis are as follows: yy Qualifications – qualifications that determine the standard of skills and abilities  of the individual professional that are recognised by employing organisations.  Many business analysts hold qualifications such as the BCS International  Diploma in Business Analysis or the IIBA® CBAP® or CCBA® certifications. The  seniority of some business analysts has also been recognised by the introduction  of the Expert BA Award offered by the BA Manager Forum. It is increasingly the  case that organisations require business analysts to hold qualifications.",952,141,238.0
46,"yy Standards – techniques and documentation standards that are applied in order  to carry out the work of the profession. Organisations typically have templates  for documents and standardise on modelling techniques such as those provided  by the Unified Modeling Language. Books such as this one are also used in  many organisations as a foundation for standards of business analysis practice. yy Continuing Professional Development – recognition of the need for the  continuing development of skills and knowledge in order to retain the pro­ fessional status. yy Professional Body – a body with responsibility for defining technical standards  and the code of conduct, promoting the profession and carrying out remedial  action where necessary.",746,112,186.5

THE FUTURE OF BUSINESS ANALYSIS Business analysis has developed into a specialist discipline that can offer significant  value to organisations, not least by assuring the delivery of business benefits and  preventing unwise investments in ill-conceived solutions.

Business analysts are passionate about their work and the contribution they  can make. They continually develop their skills and extend the breadth of work they  can undertake. Not only are they able to bridge IT and ‘the business’ but they can  also offer guidance on how to approach business change work and where priorities  might lie. Where outsourcing initiatives operate across departmental boundaries  and sometimes have impacts upon the entire organisation, the work carried out by  business analysts is vital if the new part in-house, part outsourced processes and  technology are going to deliver value to customers.",809,123,202.25
47,"The challenge for the analysts  is to ensure that they develop the extensive toolkit of skills, behavioural, business  and technical, that will enable them to engage with the problems and issues facing  their organisations, and assist in their resolution. The challenge for the organisations  is to support the analysts in their personal development, recognise the important  contribution they offer, ensure they have the authority to carry out business analysis to  the extent required by the situations they face, and listen to their advice. This book has  been developed primarily for the business analysis community but it is also intended  to help business professionals face the challenges of today’s business environment;  we hope anyone involved in defining and delivering business change will find it useful.

49,"2 THE COMPETENCIES OF A BUSINESS  ANALYST Craig Rollason INTRODUCTION Good business analysts can make the difference between a poor and a great investment  in business and IT improvements. They can also help to resolve issues without jumping  to premature conclusions. But what exactly is a good business analyst? This chapter  aims to address this question by identifying and describing the competencies that  business analysts need in order to be effective in the modern business environment.  Competence has been described as ‘the ability to do a particular activity to a prescribed  standard’ (Working Group on Vocational Qualifications, 1986).",648,98,162.0
49,"For the purposes of this  chapter, we shall define a competence as an ability a business analyst needs to perform  his or her job effectively. The set of BA competencies can be divided into three broad  groups, illustrated in Figure 2.1. Figure 2.1  The competencies of a business analyst Figure 2.1 Note:  Items marked * are covered in more detail in later chapters.  19",371,64,92.75
50,BUSINESS ANALYSIS Personal qualities are concerned with how you think and how you interact with the  people around you. They are not specific to business analysis but are general skills  that are important for developing and progressing in any business environment.  Behavioural skills are arguably more important than technical or business skills  as they are a prerequisite for working with other people. It is often said that it is  easier to give a person with good behavioural skills the techniques they need for  their job than to graft behavioural skills onto a good technician. One of the main  reasons for this is that good behavioural skills take many years to develop.,679,111,169.75
50,We  discuss the development of competencies later in this chapter. A business analyst  also requires business knowledge which helps to develop a good understanding  of their organisation and the business domain or sector within which it operates.  This knowledge is vital if the business analyst is to offer advice and insights that  will help improve the organisation’s performance. The primary source of business  knowledge is through the experience of working in a variety of organisation and  project environments. Additional business knowledge can be developed through  reading relevant literature or studying for business qualifications.,643,93,160.75
50,"The professional  techniques are those specific to the business analyst role and differentiate business  analysts from other roles. Each of the competencies shown in Figure 2.1 is discussed  in the sections that follow and others indicated are covered in more detail in later  chapters of this book.  PERSONAL QUALITIES These are the interpersonal skills and characteristics that are useful for a business  analyst. Communication Communication is perhaps the most important skill an individual can possess; it  encompasses a wide range of areas such as building rapport, listening, influencing  and building empathy. Much analysis work involves collecting and analysing data  and then presenting back information that brings new perspectives on the project  so as to propose a course of action.",794,119,198.5
50,"Poor communication skills are often cited as the  root cause of problems during discussions between business and IT staff. The key  issues involve the use of technical and business jargon, and failing to understand  the other party’s point of view during such discussions.  It is vital that we communicate with business colleagues in a language and style they  are comfortable with and avoid unfamiliar terms and references. From the analyst  perspective, it is important to understand the business, possibly by doing some prior  research, and avoid using technical language that is likely to confuse. Spending time  with the business team will help you to understand what the communication norms  are and what will be effective.",729,115,182.25
50,It is also important to adjust your communication to  align with the other people in the discussion. We need to be aware of the interests  and responsibilities of the participants and frame questions accordingly.  20,216,35,54.0
51,"THE COMPETENCIES OF A BUSINESS ANALYST Relationship building This is an extension of communication skill and concerns the ability to get on well  with people, at a working if not social level. Some people seem to possess this ability  naturally, others have to work at it but either way it is essential for a business analyst. As  a business analyst you need to get people to impart information and share opinions with  you, and also to discuss ideas for change. All of these things will be very much easier  if the people concerned like and trust you. Those who seem best able to build good  working relationships demonstrate a genuine interest in the other person and offer  open discussions which build mutual trust and respect.",731,125,182.75
51,"This is the basis for successful  relationship building. Influencing Business analysts are often involved in suggesting options and, possibly, recommending  a course of action. If that conclusion is at odds with preconceived ideas about what  is required or if it calls for radical or unexpected action, then the ability to influence  is essential. Successful influencing requires careful consideration and a concerted  effort. We need to understand the stakeholders and factors that will play a part in the  decision.",518,78,129.5
51,"Some are obvious such as the project sponsor, project manager, governance  committees, project boards and other steering groups. Some are hidden – networks  of colleagues, personal agendas, hidden information. Identifying the stakeholders and  understanding the amount of power they exert over the decision-making processes will  allow you to target and influence the decision-makers most effectively. Once decision- makers have been identified, you can then define a course of action to take the decision  forward. This may involve briefing other colleagues – more senior or representatives on  decision-making groups – or influencing business colleagues directly.",665,94,166.25
51," The influencing activities need careful consideration and prior planning. Business  analysts have to develop an understanding of where the other party stands on their  proposal, any likely resistance and the influencing style needed to approach the person  or group. For example, some managers might defer all decisions to another group,  require all information at a very detailed level or prefer just a high-level summary.  Some are interested in all the technicalities, others in just the ‘vision’ or the ‘big picture’.  Tailoring the approach is vital for a successful outcome.",582,89,145.5
51,The analysis itself may be questioned requiring the business analysts to take or suggest  another course of action. This may involve facilitating a round table discussion or seeking  support from senior colleagues on the best course of action. This is especially true when  the business analyst is caught in the middle of opposing views. It also suggests that  another personal quality that business analysts need from time to time is the ability to  withstand pressure. Team working Business analysts often work in teams.,522,83,130.5
51,"The nature of business analysis work requires  collecting information from and collaborating with many groups such as business  colleagues, suppliers, project team members and management. As a result, the ability  to work in a team is very important. An appreciation of what makes successful teams  work will benefit the business analyst who should be able to make use of their analytical  21",392,62,98.0
52,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS skills to identify any issues and opportunities that will improve how the team works.  Key factors for consideration are vision, commitment, trust, capability, accountability,  principles, creativity, responsiveness and recognition. Political awareness This is a bit like an elephant – hard to describe but you know it when you see it! One way  of defining such awareness is to use the words ‘nous’ or ‘streetwise’; they both capture  elements of political awareness. Essentially, this means the ability to work out what  is and is not politically acceptable in an organisation and being able to use the right  organisational levers to get things done.",670,104,167.5
52,"This requires an analyst to know the sources of  power and information within the organisation, understanding what is acceptable or not,  and tailoring the approach accordingly. Having political awareness, emphatically does  not mean accepting the status quo; it does mean being astute and using resourcefulness  to get results, even in the face of opposition. Analytical skills and critical thinking Since the role we are talking about here is that of business analyst, it is clear that  analytical skills form a major part of the job but what does this mean in practice? It  means not settling for the obvious, not accepting things at face value and not jumping  to premature conclusions. It means digging deeper and deeper until the true situation  is uncovered and the real problem has been defined.",803,130,200.75
52,"It involves sifting through often- conflicting data and determining which is relevant and which are not, and presenting  the results of the analysis in a form suitable for the relevant stakeholders. And it  involves challenging received wisdom at every turn: Why do you do this? What value  does it add? Where is it done? How is it done?",337,58,84.25
52,Who is or should be responsible? When  should it happen? Is there another way to do this? Some analysts seem to believe that  the job simply consists of recording what the users say they want but this will not  reap the potential rewards without the active and critical intervention of the analyst.  Over time the analyst will be able to assess the level of analysis required for a specific  situation.,402,70,100.5
52,"One maxim often used is to conduct 20 per cent of the analysis in order to  achieve 80 per cent of the right answer – and then be 100 per cent convincing when  influencing the outcome. This doesn’t mean taking shortcuts on the analysis; it does  mean recognising the key factors and the imposed constraints rather than trying to  analyse everything. Attention to detail Several aspects of the business analyst’s work require detailed investigation. Whether  it is uncovering the root causes of problems, defining the costs and benefits associated  with a proposed option, defining business requirements and rules or identifying the  impacts of proposed changes, the business analyst has a responsibility to ensure that  key information is not missed. The key competence here is to have an attention to detail  when necessary and to be able to identify when this is required.",874,142,218.5
52,Problem solving Too often business analysts complain that a solution is decided upon without there  being a full appreciation of the problem to be addressed. This focus on understanding  22,189,30,47.25
53,"THE COMPETENCIES OF A BUSINESS ANALYST the problem before rushing towards a solution is a key tenet of business analysis, – this  is where significant value can be delivered. It could be said that a business analyst is  at heart someone who likes to solve business problems. There are many techniques  and frameworks associated with creative problem solving, and Chapter 4 provides an  overview of one such approach, but problem-solving competence requires more than  just an understanding of how to approach a problem. There is a need for a problem- solving mindset, requiring curiosity, tenacity and analytical ability plus an open mind  that seeks out and evaluates options. Pragmatism is also key to successful problem  solving.",732,116,183.0
53,"Leadership Leadership is a skill that is often associated with management. However, the fundamental  characteristics of leadership – developing a vision, taking ownership of that vision and  ensuring the actions to achieve that vision are implemented – can be applied to all types  of work. Thus, leadership is highly applicable to business analysis and in this context  may be defined as creating a vision of the approaches and options available to address a  business issue, advising stakeholders in order to obtain agreement about the vision and  then driving the business and IT change process towards the achievement of that vision. No two projects are the same. Each project has different objectives, constraints and  stakeholders, and hence the required approach, skills and resources will differ.",804,124,201.0
53,"It is  important to assess each situation on its own merits, decide what is needed and then  design the analysis process. This should be within the broader context of analysing  business systems not just IT systems. The business analyst needs to consider all  aspects of the organisation or business area within which they work, including people,  culture, processes, commercial and technical aspects. Getting the vision and actions  right requires holistic thinking and rigorous analysis, and positions the project for  success with key business stakeholders. In recent years, the business analyst as a leader has emerged as a common theme in  the business analysis and wider business and IT community.",703,109,175.75
53,"For example, the ‘expert  BA’ award developed by the BA Manager Forum requires candidates to demonstrate  significant experience in leading analysis initiatives. The potential of business analysis  to innovate and transform has in some organisations propelled the role to senior levels  with executive level reporting. Different levels of leadership – self, project, organisation  and wider world – have been recognised with regard to the business analyst role (Pullan  and Archer 2013).  Self-belief This last quality is one that is often overlooked but is extremely important. It means  having sufficient self-confidence – in yourself, in the quality of your analysis, in the  relevance of your approach – to be able to withstand pressure, challenge proposals,  analyse impacts and sustain your arguments.",807,120,201.75
53,Self-belief is a key competence for  working effectively with stakeholders across the broad range of situations likely to be  encountered by business analysts. One lens that may be used to think about self-belief  is the concept of ‘locus of control’. This is the degree to which individuals themselves  believe they control events and affect them. A strong internal locus of control means  23,393,63,98.25
54,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS the individual believes they can influence the events that happen. This may be compared  with a strong external locus of control, in which events happen which the individual feels  they cannot control. A business analyst with an external locus could have difficulty in  gaining credibility with stakeholders and convincing them of the value they can deliver.  Professional development A continuous improvement mindset is also critical for the business analyst. This  should apply to personal development as well as enabling colleagues and the  organisation to develop.",586,87,146.5
54,"This will assist the organisation to focus on ongoing  learning, enabling it to adapt to new challenges in today’s fast moving business and  IT environment. This competence may be demonstrated through various activities  such as coaching, mentoring, training delivery, contribution to professional forums  and applying for business analysis awards.  BUSINESS KNOWLEDGE This section considers the range of business knowledge and understanding which is  essential as a background and foundation for the business analyst’s work. Business finance The universal language of business is finance. Whether the business analyst is working  in the commercial, government or non-profit sectors of the economy, finance plays a  key role in deciding what funds are available and what can and cannot be done.",794,117,198.5
54,"As a  result, the business analyst needs to have a good working knowledge of the basics of  business finance. This includes a general understanding of aspects such as the balance  sheet and income statement (profit and loss account), financial analysis tools like ratio  analysis, budgeting and cash flow, the nature of profit or surplus, and the principles  of costing products and services. Without this understanding, it is not possible for an  analyst to evaluate suppliers, deliver well-thought-through process improvements or  evaluate options in business cases. Business case development Much of the business analyst’s work will be to assess the costs and benefits of delivering  a project to the organisation. So, when communicating analysis findings, it is important  to ensure that you have a view on the financial impact that the project will have.",859,133,214.75
54,"In its  own right, IT is only an enabling tool for business benefits to be achieved and a business  analysis project may involve other specialists, such as management accountants, to  model the business activities and determine how IT can deliver financial benefit. To  develop the business case, a basic understanding of finance, as described above, is  required. Business analysts involved in business case preparation will need to understand  investment appraisal techniques such as break-even analysis and discounted cash flow;  these techniques are explained in Chapter 9. Over recent years many business analysts  have developed a greater understanding of the benefits and costs of technical solutions.  This is a positive development as it enables analysts to disregard costly options quickly,  and ensure that they deliver value from their analysis work.",862,129,215.5

Apart from the general domain, there is  more specific domain knowledge, for instance, supermarkets within the retail domain  and social care within local government. The reasons why this knowledge is required  are threefold: yy It enables you to communicate with the business people involved in the  project, using language with which they are familiar – the personal qualities of  communication and relationship building also help here. yy It will help you to understand what would, and would not, be acceptable or  useful to this business domain; issues of profit, for instance, are unlikely to be  of interest when working in a social security department. yy It may enable you to use ideas and experiences – particularly those relating to  best practice from an organisation, typically but not necessarily within the same  business domain, and apply them elsewhere.",1053,163,263.25
55,"Subject matter expertise Subject matter expertise is more specific, taking the domain knowledge to a lower level  of detail. If working on a particular area such as a specific product line or service, a good  understanding of the terminology, processes and constraints is important to establish  credibility with the customer. Business analysts may be specialists in particular  business domains and have a strong understanding of the subject area. This will enable  them to communicate more easily with the business staff and identify potential areas  for change or further analysis.  Principles of information technology Many business analysts do not come from an IT background and say – rightly – that  their job is not to be expert in IT-related issues; that, after all, is why there are technical  architects, developers and testers.",838,131,209.5
55,"However, the original conception of business analysis  was as a ‘bridging’ role, enabling the communication between the business and IT  staff. Given that the majority of business analysis projects result in the use of software  applications, a general understanding of IT and software development approaches  is necessary so that business analysts can communicate meaningfully with the IT  professionals and appreciate their role and contribution to the systems development  process. The increasing use of Agile approaches has placed a greater responsibility on  business analysts to understand IT and related issues.  The extent to which you will need technical knowledge will depend on the nature of  the analysis work being undertaken. Whilst strong technical knowledge is often useful  this may be better obtained from those with specialist skills, for example, solution and  enterprise architects, developers or external suppliers.",937,136,234.25
55,"The key requirement is that the  business analyst can understand the technical terms used by IT specialists and help the  business users to appreciate any impacts on the organisation.

Organisation structures As well as improving processes and IT, many business analysis projects involve  restructuring divisions or teams – to a greater or lesser degree – in order to remove  hand-offs, centralise tasks or improve the customer service. For these reasons,  it is important for a business analyst to have a good understanding of the various  organisation structures that may be encountered – functional, project, matrix and so  on – and of their relative strengths and weaknesses. Supplier management Many organisations use external suppliers to deliver their IT systems, either on an  ad-hoc basis or perhaps through a more comprehensive outsourcing arrangement  which may cover whole business processes or even an entire business function.  For example, many organisations have outsourced their payroll for several years  but some have now extended this to cover much of the human resources work from  recruitment to record keeping.",1605,239,401.25
56,"The selection and contracting of suppliers tends to  fall within the domain of the procurement function. However, for some outsourcing  contracts the business analyst may be involved in this work so needs a broad  understanding of procurement and supplier management processes. As a minimum,  business analysts should be aware of the different contractual arrangements that  are available, for example: yy Time and materials – where the contracted party is paid on the basis of the  time worked; this is not the elapsed time on the project but the amount of effort  employed. yy Fixed price delivery – where the contracted party is paid the price that they  agreed for the delivery of the work in line with the original specification. yy Risk and reward – where the contracted party has agreed to bear some or all  of the risk of the project, for example, by investing resources such as staff time,  materials or office space, but where the potential rewards are greater than  under other contractual arrangements.",1014,167,253.5

61,THE COMPETENCIES OF A BUSINESS ANALYST HOW CAN I DEVELOP MY SKILLS? Earlier sections of this chapter have identified a wide range of skills that a business  analyst will eventually want to master and the list may appear to be rather daunting.  The first step in developing as a business analyst is to understand the skills required  of a business analyst in your organisation. This should include an assessment of both  the current and future skills required. Your HR department or line management may be  able to provide an outline definition of the requirements for the business analyst role;  there may be an internal career development framework available that sets out the  skill requirements for different roles and grades.,729,119,182.25
61,"Alternatively, an existing framework  such as The Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA) can be very helpful. This  framework is described more fully in the next section. Essentially, there are four ways in which business analysts can develop their  competencies: Training This is particularly useful in developing professional techniques, business knowledge  and, to some extent, personal skills. Classroom-based training can be an efficient  approach to acquiring skills and knowledge and enables learners to practise their  application in a relatively safe environment, with a tutor on hand to offer support,  guidance and encouragement. It also allows participants to share knowledge and  experience which helps to enrich the learning experience.",759,109,189.75
61,"Some training courses lead  to industry qualifications, such as those offered by BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT.  Industry qualifications are discussed later in this chapter. A recent development in the  UK is the ‘Expert BA Award’, an award that recognises the business analysts operating  at senior levels within their organisations and is assessed against many of the skills  identified within this chapter. Self-study Self-study is an excellent way for analysts to develop their business and professional  knowledge. There is a wide variety of reference books available, including many on  topics relevant to business analysis such as process modelling and requirements  analysis.",689,102,172.25
61,"Publications that help develop business knowledge include the Financial Times,  the Economist and the Harvard Business Review. Such self-study will help broaden and  deepen the analyst’s understanding of the business world. The internet also provides a  wealth of resources including specialist websites, articles and blogs.  Workplace experience This provides an opportunity to use and improve techniques and to deepen business  knowledge and it is also the best arena for a business analyst to develop their personal  skills. The performance of most analysts improves over time as their experience grows  but this can be heightened and accelerated if working within an organisation that  operates a formalised skills development programme using coaching or mentoring.",769,112,192.25

If you wish to develop and improve your performance it is important to understand the  range of required skills, identify your competence in each skill area and then take the  relevant learning opportunities.  Historically, business analyst jobs and qualifications have focused on the construction  of systems that ‘meet business requirements’. This has meant that the focus is on  collecting requirements in an organised and logical fashion that are then used to select  or build systems which meet those needs. The need for people who can do this is now  a lot wider and there is much more emphasis on the importance of this task, often as  a result of the sourcing options available to organisations.",832,135,208.0
65,"Where external suppliers  are used, defining IT requirements is even more important, particularly where they are  located in another country – offshore sourcing as this is known. Critically, the stakes are  being raised higher for IT projects; IT departments that cannot show or communicate  how they add value are becoming an endangered species as more and more IT-aware  people enter business organisations. Business analysts can only survive and evolve  if they offer a broad set of skills that demonstrate how they can identify, analyse and  develop options for adding value to their organisation.  It is in the area of personal skills that perhaps the biggest challenges lie for business  analysts. Anyone working in business change is only too aware of the apprehension, and  even resentment, that change projects engender.",829,129,207.25

68,"3 STRATEGY ANALYSIS Donald Yeates INTRODUCTION  This chapter is about four aspects of strategy analysis: yy understanding what strategy is and why it is important, the assumption being  that strategy is important; yy exploring some ideas about how strategy is developed; yy implementing strategy; yy working out what all of this means for business analysts. There is no intention to try to turn you into strategic planners but instead to enable you  to understand the process of strategy development, be comfortable with the tools that  managers use and be able to use them yourself as you explore how new or different  information systems could push forward the activities of the organisation that employs  you. THE CONTEXT FOR STRATEGY Why do organisations bother about strategy? What advantage do they hope to gain?  Let us look at what is happening in the world.",866,141,216.5
68,"Most of us would probably support the  idea that business is becoming increasingly unpredictable and changes are more  turbulent, with international mergers and acquisitions once again becoming regular  features of business life as economies come out of the post-banking crisis recession.  The information revolution and the digital economy have caused much of this dramatic  change and barriers between previously separate businesses are falling like dominoes.  For example, who will be the big financial players in the future? It could be the global  banks, retail outlets like Tesco or Walmart, strong brands like Amazon or Virgin. If you  are working in the finance sector how do you know where to move next?",712,111,178.0
68,What are the  longer term implications of government shareholdings?  There are some big changes that organisations face and that strategy development  tries to moderate: yy There are the changes to the ways that we are employed. There is much more  use of part-time and contract employees who may have little long-term loyalty to  their employer and who have their own individual career and work/life balance  38,412,66,103.0
69,"STRATEGY ANALYSIS 	 plans. The growth of knowledge-based industries and the continuous change  experienced by organisations means that individual employees, consultants or  contractors – permanent, full-time or part-time – have become valuable assets.  This is more than ever the case as organisations everywhere, in both Government  and commercial sectors, flatten their organisation structures, decentralise  decision-making and give more freedom to individuals to make decisions, deal  with customers and resolve problems. There are no longer jobs for life and  attitudes to work have changed. We all now want great job satisfaction, higher  rewards, more personal recognition and flexible working environments.",714,98,178.5
69,"yy Society has changed. There is greater freedom of expression and of thought.  Freedom of information legislation means that individuals have access to  evidence and decisions taken by government that were previously hidden. There  is less respect for authority and office unless it has been earned. Our attitudes  to change, direction, reorganisation and other people knowing better than we do  have shifted and the development and implementation of new strategies need  to take this into account.",499,76,124.75
69,yy Organisations are responding to these changes by doing everything they can  to increase their flexibility and responsiveness. This means that they seek to  reduce employment costs and without trade unions to apply a brake we see  central government and European institutions taking this role. yy The world is full of contradictions. Some of these are: ß Global versus local. Globalisation creates the largest markets ever known  and until we have intergalactic businesses this will remain the case!,502,78,125.5
69,"But it  also means that the players in a global market can be small. Having a global  reach does not mean being the biggest. The scarcity of the product, its brand  reputation and its distribution channels make the difference. All the paparazzi  know this; one paparazzo, with access to a camera, the right moment and the  internet, sells his product across the world in less than a day. ß Centralised versus decentralised organisation structures.",448,74,112.0
69,"Finance may be a  central process but prices and discounts are set locally. ß Hard and soft management. Developing strategy is seen as a ‘hard’ discipline  like finance and technology but the creativity and change skills that make  strategy work are the ‘soft’ skills.  Finally there are two questions. How can anyone create, formulate or build a strategy if  the future is inherently unknowable and unpredictable, and how can it be implemented  in a coherent way in decentralised structures with delegated authorities and an ever- changing environment?",554,87,138.5
69,"This makes it appear very difficult for a business analyst to  understand the nature and permanence – or impermanence – of the business strategies  against which IS strategies are to be built. However, as we shall see, through an  examination of the nature of strategy and the use of some well-tried tools, effective  steps can be taken to deal with this difficulty. WHAT IS STRATEGY? The concept of strategy begins in a military context and the word strategy is derived  from the Greek word ‘strategia’ which means ‘generalship’. It has a ‘getting ready for  39",562,95,140.5
70,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS battle’ sense to it and the deployment of troops, weapons, aircraft and ships before  engagement with the enemy begins. Once the enemy is engaged then battlefield tactics  determine the success of the strategy. The transfer of these ideas into business is easy  to make, therefore, and we expect to deal with: yy The goal or mission of the business. In strategy terms this is often referred to  as the direction. yy The time frame.",449,76,112.25
70,"Strategy is about the long term. The problem here is that it  differs widely across industries, with petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals at  the really long end and domestic financial services products at the short end. yy The organisation of resources such as finance, skills, assets and technical  competence so that the organisation can compete. yy The environment within which the organisation will operate and its markets. A popular definition appears in Johnson, Scholes and Whittington (2008): Strategy is the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term, which  achieves advantage in a changing environment through its configuration of resources  and competences with the aim of fulfilling stakeholder expectations.",735,109,183.75
70,"However, writers and gurus have offered their own definitions for at least the last 40  years including George Steiner (1979) who did not so much define it as paint a picture  of it by saying that strategy is: yy what top management does; yy about direction; yy the process that sets in motion the important actions necessary to achieve  these directions; yy what the organisation should be doing. But finally, Johnson, Scholes and Whittington (2008) provide a helpful definition of the  issues to be considered during strategy analysis. These are: yy the long-term direction of an organisation; yy the scope of an organisation’s activities; yy advantage for the organisation over competition; yy strategic fit with the business environment; yy the organisation’s resources and competences; yy the values and expectations of powerful actors. Strategies exist at different levels in an organisation ranging from corporate strategies  at the top level affecting the complete organisation down to the operational strategies  for product/services offerings. Typical levels of strategy could be: 40",1093,167,273.25
71,"STRATEGY ANALYSIS yy Corporate Strategy that is concerned with the overall purpose and scope of the  business. Strategies at this level are influenced by investors, governments and  global competition, and by the context set out earlier in this chapter. It is the  basis of all other strategies and strategic decisions.  yy Business Unit Strategy. Below the corporate level are the strategic business  units (SBUs).",415,64,103.75
71,"These are organisational units for which there are distinct external  markets that are different from those of other SBUs. SBU strategies address  choice of products, pricing, customer satisfaction, and competitive advantage. yy Operational Strategy focuses on the delivery of the corporate and SBU strategies  through the effective organisation and development of resources, processes  and people. STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT This section begins with some fundamental questions: How do I start to develop a  strategy? Where does strategy development come from?",554,78,138.5
71,"How do I know what kinds  of strategy to develop? There are many different drivers for strategy development and  strategy may be formulated in different ways. For example: yy Strategy associated with an individual, often the founder of a business.  Examples of founders who set strategy include Mark Zuckerberg and Richard  Branson. Where a business is already established but needs a new direction,  a new CEO may be brought in to change the strategy in order to move the  organisation forward.",495,81,123.75
71," yy Alternatively, strategy may develop from the experiences and views of internal  managers. Groups of managers may meet regularly to review trends in the  market and their own business progress; they plan new actions and try them  out. Strategy then evolves in an incremental, negotiated way. yy Another possibility is to enable the generation of innovative ideas from within  the organisation so that the strategy emerges from the people who do the work. yy It is also possible to formulate strategy by adopting a formal, carefully planned,  design process.",560,89,140.0
71,"Some organisations find this to be essential, especially those  for which strategy is truly long term. So far the development of strategy has been considered as a rational, logical and  organised process. It often is developed like this, and in this chapter we will consider  many of the tools that are used to inform the strategy process. However, another force  that may drive strategy formulation is the politics within the organisation. We can view  an organisation as a political system that manipulates the formation of strategy through  the exercise of power.",566,91,141.5
71,"Different interest groups form around different strategic ideas  or issues and compete for resources and the support of stakeholders to achieve the  dominance of their ideas. On this basis, strategic direction is not achieved through a  universally accepted, rational analysis but through the promotion of specific ideas of  the most powerful – and usually highly political – groups. This power comes from five  main sources: 41",428,66,107.0
72,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS yy Dependency – departments are dependent on those departments that have  control over the organisation’s resources. The power of the human resources  (HR) department increases if all new staff requisitions have to be authorised  by HR. yy Financial resources – where are the funds to invest in the development of new  ideas, products or services? Who has these funds? What financial frameworks  constrain or give freedom to different groups?",460,71,115.0
72,"yy Position – where do the actors live in the organisation structure and how does  their work affect the organisation’s performance? yy Uniqueness – no other part of the organisation can do what the powerful group  does. yy Uncertainty – power resides with people and groups can cope with the  unpredictable effects of the environment and protect others from its impact. Whichever approach is adopted and whatever the internal politics, the development  of strategy always needs to incorporate some external analysis, for instance ‘what  is happening out there?’, some internal analysis, such as ‘where do we fit in to what’s  happening out there?’,",649,103,162.25
72,"plus some consideration of how new strategies could be  executed.  Once a strategy has been developed, it is important to provide a written statement of the  strategy. This written statement is needed for many reasons: yy it provides a focus for the organisation and enables all parts of it to understand  the reasons behind top-level decisions and how each part can contribute to its  achievement; yy it provides a framework for a practical allocation of investment and other  resources; yy it provides a guide to innovation, where new products, services or systems are  needed; yy it enables appropriate performance measures to be put in place that measure  the key indicators of our success in achieving the strategy; yy it tells the outside world, especially our outside stakeholders and market  analysts, about us and develops the expectations that they hold. EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS Most organisations face a complex and changing external environment of increasing  unpredictability. Let us take as an example a retail electrical and electronics store which  faces some or all of the following external changes: yy The state of the national and local economies.",1173,185,293.25
72,Product demand is influenced by  local employment and incomes and the cost of credit. 42,88,15,22.0
73,STRATEGY ANALYSIS yy Product cost. Price competition is high and there is a continuing shift to move  manufacturing to lower cost economies with the possible impact on supply and  after-sales support. yy Changes in consumer lifestyles and tastes. The high cost of housing leads to a  greater incidence of smaller houses and a growth in the supply of flats calling  for smaller furniture and kitchen equipment. Streaming films replaces DVD or  Blu-ray and streaming music replaces digital downloads.,498,78,124.5
73,"yy Changes in technology. There is a greater demand for smaller devices, flatter  screens and multi-purpose devices. yy New marketing approaches with consumers buying over the internet or from  catalogue retailers. With a little thought it would have been possible to identify these kinds of environmental  trends but many of the more dramatic changes have come from surprising places.  For example, the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) was introduced in response to  a number of major corporate and accounting scandals, most notably at Enron and  Tyco International.",567,87,141.75
73,"Although it was clear that something had to be done, critics have  claimed that SOX places US firms at a disadvantage compared to overseas competitors  and imposes high additional costs on business. More dramatic and unexpected are  the activities of environmental or animal rights campaigners or a sudden change in  technology that changes generally accepted business models. There is a framework to help organisations assess their broad environment. It is the  PESTLE analysis – sometimes called a PESTEL or just PEST analysis – but whatever  the acronym it is an examination of the political, economic, socio-cultural, technological,  legal and environmental issues in the external business environment. Some of the  influences which may be identified in these categories are shown below.",791,120,197.75
73,Political influences yy The stability of the government or political situation yy Government policies – such as on social welfare yy Trade regulations and tariffs Economic influences yy Interest rates yy Money supply yy Inflation yy Unemployment yy Disposable income yy Availability and cost of energy yy The internationalisation of business Taken together these economic factors determine how easy –  or not – it is to be profitable because they affect demand. 43,464,73,116.0
74,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Socio-cultural  influences yy Demographics – such as an ageing population in  Europe yy Social mobility – will people move to find work or  stay unemployed where they are and rely on state  support? This may also be seen as a political issue  with an enlarged Europe enabling a freer movement  of labour across the community yy Lifestyle changes – such as changes in the retirement  age and general changes in people’s views about  work/life balance Technological  influences yy Technological developments yy Government spending on research, the quality of  academic research, the ‘brain drain’ yy The focus on technology; demand for invention and  innovation yy The pace of technological change, the creation of  technology enabled industries Legal influences yy Legislation about trade practices and competition yy Employment law – employment protection, discrimi­ nation etc yy Health and safety legislation yy Company law yy Financial regulation Environmental  influences yy Global warming and climate change yy Animal welfare yy Waste, such as unnecessary packaging yy Environmental protection legislation such as new  laws on recycling and waste disposal industries It is important that we do not view PESTLE analysis as a set of checklists as these  are not of themselves useful in making a strategic assessment. The key tasks are to  identify those few factors that will really affect the organisation and to develop a real  understanding of how they might evolve in the future. In some cases a few issues may  be so important that they provide a natural focus. It may also be helpful to get external  expert opinion.",1643,259,410.75
74,"Having examined the external environment we should now consider the competition our  organisation faces. Few businesses have no competition, even those in the not-for-profit  sector, and most seek to develop and keep a competitive advantage over their rivals.

75,"STRATEGY ANALYSIS that helps to evaluate an industry’s profitability and hence its attractiveness is Michael  Porter’s Five Forces model (Porter 1980). This is shown in Figure 3.1 below. In the centre  is the competitive battleground where rivals compete and where competitive strategies  are developed. Organisations need to understand the nature of their competitive  environment. Additionally, they will be in a stronger position if they understand the  interplay of the five forces and can develop defences against the threats they pose.",541,80,135.25

This may be difficult to achieve for a new entrant. yy Substantial investment required.,413,67,103.25
75,"A new entrant may have difficulty in obtaining  sufficient funds for investment. yy Product differentiation.

76,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS yy The existence of patented processes. yy The need for regulatory approval, for example, in the financial and defence  sectors. Supplier power limits the opportunity for cost reductions when: yy there is a concentration of suppliers and when supplying businesses are bigger  than the many customers they supply; yy the costs of switching from one supplier to another are high. This may be  because of clauses in supply contracts, interacting IT systems between the  organisation and its suppliers, supply logistics or the inability of other suppliers  to deliver; yy the supplier brand is powerful, for example, the power of ‘Intel Inside’; yy customers are fragmented so do not have a collective influence. Customer power – or the bargaining power of buyers as Porter called it – is high when: yy there are many small organisations on the supply side.",871,141,217.75
76,"For example, in the  supply of food products to supermarkets; yy alternative sources of supply are available and easy to find; yy the cost of the product or service is high, encouraging the buyer to search out  alternatives; yy switching costs are low. The threat from substitute products is high when: yy product substitution from new technologies is more convenient; yy the need for the product may be replaced by meeting a different need; yy it is possible to decide to ‘do without it’! All of these forces impact on the competitive battleground in some way. There may also  be high competitive rivalry when: yy there are many competing firms; yy buyers can easily switch from one firm to another; yy the market is growing only slowly or not growing at all; yy the industry has high fixed costs and responding to price pressure is difficult; yy products are not well differentiated or are commoditised so there is little brand  loyalty; yy the costs of leaving the industry are high.

There are also views that it  is difficult to apply the model to not-for-profit organisations and that since the 1980s  the increasing development of international businesses has led to a more complex set  of competitive and collaborative relationships.

77,"Having used PESTLE and Porter to analyse the external environment, we will have  much useful data about the external conditions the organisation may face.

77,"They begin by identifying the potential  high impact and high uncertainty factors in the environment. It is tempting to choose  just two scenarios – good and bad – when doing this, but really four or more are needed  and they should be plausible and detailed. Next, the future scenarios these factors could  construct are considered, possibly by looking at the possible steps and asking ‘what if?’  questions. In doing this we are concerned with predetermined events such as predicted  demographic changes, key uncertainties – often political and economic, including  regulation and world trade – and driving forces such as technology and education.",649,102,162.25
77,This  information comes from the PESTLE analysis. INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS The external environment creates opportunities and threats and can give an  ‘outside/in’ stimulus to the development of strategy. Successful strategies depend  on something else as well; it is the capability of the organisation to perform. Can an  organisation continue to change its capability so that it constantly fits the environment  in which it operates? Can it always be innovative in the way it exploits this capability?,508,76,127.0
77," Two techniques that help in the analysis of the internal organisation are discussed in  this section – the resource audit and portfolio analysis using the Boston Matrix. All of  this begins, however, with an understanding of the current business positioning, and  for this we will consider the MOST analysis technique. MOST analysis examines the  current mission, objectives, strategy and tactics and considers whether or not these  are clearly defined and supported within the organisation. We can define the MOST  terms as follows: yy Mission A statement declaring what business the organisation is in and what  it is intending to achieve. yy Objectives The specific goals against which the organisation’s achievements  can be measured.",739,113,184.75
77,yy Strategy The medium to long-term approach that is going to be taken by the  organisation in order to achieve the objectives and mission. yy Tactics The detailed means by which the strategy will be executed. 47,212,37,53.0
78,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS A clear mission driving the organisation forward, a set of measurable objectives and  a coherent strategy will enhance the capability of the organisation and be a source  of strength. On the other hand, where there is a lack of direction, unclear objectives  and an ill-defined strategy the internal capability is less effective and we have a  source of weakness. When considering the MOST analysis as a means of identifying  strengths and weaknesses, it is useful to think about the following aspects: yy Is the MOST clearly defined? For example, are the objectives well-formed and  SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time framed)? yy Is there congruence between elements of the SWOT (strengths, weaknesses,  opportunities, threats)(see below)?",782,118,195.5
78,"For example, is the strategy aligned with  the objectives? yy Has the MOST been communicated to the managers and staff of the  organisation? Reflecting on core competences starts the strategy process from inside the organisation  so it is an ‘inside/out’ approach based on the belief that competitiveness comes from  an ability to create new and unexpected products and services from a set of core  competences. The Resource Audit can help us to identify core competences or may  highlight where there is a lack of competence that could undermine any competitive  moves. There are five key areas to examine, the first three being sets of tangible  resource: yy The first area relates to the physical resources that the organisation owns or  has access to and includes features such as buildings, plant and equipment,  land and so on.",833,136,208.25
78,"These may be modern and cost-effective or old-fashioned,  unreliable and incur high maintenance costs. yy Second, there are the financial resources that determine the organisation’s  financial stability, capacity to invest in new resources and ability to weather  business fluctuations and changes.  yy Then, there are the human resources and their expertise, adaptability,  commitment, etc. There are then the intangible resources such as the know-how of the organisation  which may include actual patents or trademarks, but this may also be derived from the  use made of resources such as information and technology; many organisations hold a  large amount of information but it is not available when required or not in a format that  can be used easily. Another intangible resource is the reputation of the organisation, for  example the brand recognition and the belief that is held about the quality of the brand,  and the goodwill – or antipathy – that this produces.",973,152,243.25
78,"An analysis of the organisation’s  resources will identify where these provide a source of competence – strengths, or  where there is a lack of capability – weaknesses.  The portfolio of business units, each offering their own products and services, may also  be a source of strength or weakness for an organisation. Organisations need to review  their portfolio on a regular basis in order to take decisions about the resources to be  invested into each business unit or even each product or service. Portfolio analysis was  developed to address this problem.  48",564,91,141.0
79,"STRATEGY ANALYSIS The original portfolio matrix – the Boston Box – was developed by the Boston Consulting  Group and provides a means of conducting portfolio analysis. A company’s strategic  business units (SBUs) – parts of an organisation for which there is a distinct and  separate external market – are identified and the relationship between the SBU’s  current or future revenue potential is modelled against the current share of the market.  The Boston Box uses these two dimensions to enable organisations to categorise their  SBUs and their products/services, and thereby consider whether and how much to  invest. Put simply as in Figure 3.2, the cows are milked, the dogs are buried, the stars  get the gold and the wild cats are carefully examined until they behave themselves or  join the dogs and die. Figure 3.2  The Boston Box Figure 3.2 A successful product or SBU starts as a Wild Cat and goes clockwise round the model  until it dies or is revitalised as a new product or service or SBU.",1003,169,250.75
79,"The Wild Cats (or Problem  Children) are unprofitable but are investments for the future; the Stars strengthen their  position in a growth industry until they become the big profit earners. The Cash Cows  are the mature products or services, in markets with little, if any, growth. The Stars and  Cash Cows provide the funding for the other segments of the matrix. The Dogs have low  market share in markets with low growth and are often the areas that are removed or  allowed to wither away. SWOT ANALYSIS The SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis is often used to pull  together the results of an analysis of the external and internal environments.",674,111,168.5
79,"However,  too often it is used as the first analytical tool before enough preparatory analysis has  been done. When this approach is adopted the results are usually weak, inconclusive and  insufficiently robust to be of much use. A more robust approach is to use the techniques  described earlier as they help identify the major factors, both internal and external  to the organisation, that the business strategy needs to take into account. Hence, the  SWOT analysis is where we summarise the key strengths, weaknesses, opportunities  and threats in order to carry out an overall audit of the strategic position of a business  49",630,102,157.5
80,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS and its environment. A SWOT analysis is often represented as a two-by-two matrix as  shown in Figure 3.3. Figure 3.3  Format of a SWOT matrix Figure 3 .3 The language of a SWOT is important. It needs to be brief, with strengths and weaknesses  related to critical success factors. Strengths and weaknesses should also be measured  against the competition.",373,61,93.25
80,"All statements should be specific, realistic and supported by  evidence. Some examples – not for the same organisation – could be: yy Strengths Strong product branding – market research shows a high awareness  of our brands compared with the competition. We secure ‘best space’ in all  branches of the top five retailers. yy Weakness We have poor cash flow. Against industry benchmarks we are in the  bottom quartile.",417,68,104.25
80,We exceed our overdraft limits on 19 days every quarter. yy Opportunity Demographic change in Europe and the US will provide a greater  market for our products. yy Threat Low market growth will see increased concentration of business through  acquisition. The poorest performing businesses will fail. A key point that emerges from these examples is that strengths and weaknesses are  found within the organisation (and hence discovered via the resource audit or the  Boston Matrix) whereas opportunities and threats arise from outside the organisation  (and hence can be found using PESTLE or the Five Forces model).,616,96,154.0
80,"It is important to get right the balance between the external and the internal analysis.  Completely changing the nature of the organisation because of the external analysis  may lead to radical change but without any assurance that capability exists to deliver  this successfully. Basing everything on an internal analysis may lead to little or no  change, or changes that are internally focused and ignore the desires of the customers.  Using both analyses is more balanced and is likely to contribute towards the creation of  a more robust strategic direction.  50",567,90,141.75
81,"STRATEGY ANALYSIS EXECUTING STRATEGY Executing new strategies implies risk because it involves change. There are three  particular aspects of implementing strategy – the context for the strategy, the role of  the leader and two tools that we can use – the Balanced Business Scorecard and the  McKinsey 7-S Model.  There are five contextual issues to be considered. yy Time – how quickly does the new strategy need to be implemented? What pace  of change is needed?",464,76,116.0
81,yy Scope – how big is the change? Is the new strategic direction transformational  or incremental? yy Capability – does the organisation have the required resources for the change?  is the organisation adaptable and able to change? Are the experiences of  change positive or negative?,284,45,71.0
81," yy Readiness – is the whole organisation, or the part of it to be affected, ready to  make the change? yy Strategic leadership – is there a strategic leader for the change? In this context, the strategic leader will have the key role. Typically, the strategic  leaders we read about are the top managers but strategic leadership does not have  to be delivered from the top; there are many successful strategic changes that have  been driven from other parts of the organisation. The leader needs to demonstrate the  following key characteristics: yy Challenges the status quo all the time and sets new and demanding targets,  never being prepared to tolerate unsatisfactory behaviour or performance.",700,114,175.0
81,"yy Establishes and communicates a clear vision of the direction to be taken, why  it has to be taken and how the journey will be made. This means establishing  the new mission, setting out objectives, identifying the strategies for achieving  them and defining the specific tactics to deliver them. The leader also clearly  communicates the values that underpin the business. yy ‘Models the way’ or ‘Walks the walk’. He or she demonstrates through their  behaviour how everyone else should behave and act in order to deliver the  strategy.",539,88,134.75
81,"yy Empowers people to deliver their part of the strategic change within the vision,  values and mission that have been set out. The leader cannot be everywhere,  so others need to play their part. yy Celebrates success with those who achieve it.  Two tools that help in the execution of strategy are the McKinsey 7-S Model shown in  Figure 3.4 below and the Balanced Business Scorecard shown in Figure 3.5. 51",409,71,102.25
82,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Figure 3.4  McKinsey’s 7-S Model Figure 3. 4 The 7-S model supposes that all organisations are made up of seven components. Three  are often described as ‘hard’ components – strategy, structure and systems, and four as  ‘soft’ – shared values, style, staff and skills. These are the seven levers that can be used in the implementation of strategic change  and they are all interlinked. All seven need attention if the strategy is to be executed  successfully, because if there is a change with one, others will be affected.",541,90,135.25
82,"Changing  one element, such as the strategy, means that all of the others have to change as well. yy The structure – the basis for building the organisation will change to reflect  new needs for specialisation and coordination resulting from the new strategic  direction. yy Formal and informal systems that supported the old system must change. yy The style or culture of the organisation will be affected by a new strategic  direction. Values, beliefs and norms, which developed over time, may be revised  or even swept away.",527,87,131.75
82,"yy The way staff are recruited, developed and rewarded may change. New  strategies may mean relocating people or making them redundant. yy Skills – competences acquired in the past may be of less use now. The new  strategy may call for new skills. yy Shared values are the guiding concepts of the organisation, the fundamental  ideas that are the basis of the organisation.",373,63,93.25
82,"Moving from an ‘engineering first’  company to a ‘customer service first’ company would change the shared values. As important as the individual elements of the 7-S model, are the connections between  them. The execution of strategy will be flawed if, for example, there is a disconnect  between the style adopted by management and the shared values of the organisation. 52",373,60,93.25
83,"STRATEGY ANALYSIS The Balanced Business Scorecard (BBS) can be thought of as the strategic balance  sheet for an organisation as it captures the means of assessing the financial and non- financial components of a strategy. It therefore shows how the strategy execution is  working and the effectiveness with which the levers for change are being used. The  BBS supplements financial measures with three other perspectives of organisational  performance – customers, learning and growth, and internal business processes. Vision  and strategy connect with each of these as shown in Figure 3.5. Figure 3.5  The Balanced Business Scorecard Figure 3.",645,98,161.25
83,"5 The emphasis of the scorecard is to measure aspects of performance in a balanced  way. In the past, managers have perhaps paid more attention to the financial measures  but the BBS shows it is important to consider all of the four aspects. The customer  perspective measures those critical success factors that provide a customer focus. It  forces a detailed examination to be made of statements like ‘superior customer service’  so that everyone can agree what it means, and measures can be established to show  the progress being made. It also identifies the need to consider how the customers view  the organisation and its products or services.",650,107,162.5
83,The delivery of value to the customers is  likely to affected by the internal processes so the process effectiveness also needs to be  measured. The learning and growth perspective could generate a need for new products  or new internal processes if the organisation is to continue to perform well. All of these  aspects are important when evaluating organisational performance. Each perspective answers questions like these: yy Financial – what level of income has been generated? How profitable is the  business?,514,80,128.5
83,yy Customer – how will we assess our customer satisfaction? yy Learning and Growth – how will we measure our ability to change and improve  so that we constantly keep ahead of the competition? yy Internal Business Processes – how effective are the business processes that  we must excel at to deliver customer value? 53,319,55,79.75
84,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS The BBS helps in the definition of two components which are vital to assess business  performance; these are Critical Success Factors (CSFs) and Key Performance Indicators  (KPIs).  The concept of CSFs was initially developed in the late 1970s when they were defined  as ‘the few key areas where “things must go right” for the business to flourish and for  a manager’s goals to be attained’ (Rockart in the Harvard Business Review, March/April  1979). The important words here are ‘few’, key’ and ‘must’. Not every activity is a key  area; they are fewer in number than people think and success with them is critical but  the CSFs mean that there are some goals that must be reached. However, it is of little  use setting goals and then realising too late that you won’t make it.",797,136,199.25
84,"This is where KPIs  are required. KPIs are the measures that show whether or not progress is being made  towards the achievement of a CSF. KPIs measure specific areas of performance so also  limit the amount of data that managers have to consider and act upon. Let us see how this could work for a healthcare organisation, such as a hospital, using  the BBS as a framework. First, the CSFs in the financial area will be considered.",431,77,107.75
84,"The  hospital management might state that income must be greater than expenses, perhaps  by a set percentage. It is important that the hospital sets this CSF specifically for its  own circumstances rather than using a national target. CSFs must be our CSFs or there  would be little identification with the effort required to achieve them. Generated from  this CSF might therefore be strict cost control on the purchase of drugs and of treatment  equipment. So, we would set financial KPIs to monitor and control the prescription of  drugs and treatments; each KPI would have a set target which, in this case, could be  a defined budget for expenditure of drugs and treatments each year.",687,114,171.75
84,"This is also an  example of where CSFs in one area can affect CSFs in other areas; if the low cost drugs  and treatments we use mean that it takes longer to get better with us, then how does  that impact on a customer service CSF of reducing the waiting time for treatment?  It’s important that KPIs are defined such that they are SMART and that they are  monitored regularly. If the drugs budget is exceeded within the first few months, what  action will be taken to bring it back to budget before the overspend becomes too difficult  to manage? Other parts of the BBS can also generate CSFs so long as they are critical; for our  hospital it is tempting to regard patient satisfaction as a critical success factor. Is it really  critical or should the goal be to improve people’s health, provide life-saving surgery and  so on?",829,149,207.25
84,It can be difficult to determine the truly critical success factors. It is an excellent  discipline to ensure that only those that are critical are identified; it is not possible to  monitor too many factors at one time. There is a suggestion later in Chapter 6 about how  CSFs and KPIs could be used in the construction of Business Activity Models. SUMMARY This chapter has looked at the reasons why organisations develop strategies and how  they might do this. We have explored the complexity of this process and offered ideas  about how strategies are developed taking account of entrepreneurial approaches  and formal planning.,631,103,157.75

86,"4 THE BUSINESS ANALYSIS PROCESS  MODEL Debra Paul INTRODUCTION There are many tools and techniques available for the business analyst to use and,  because of the nature of business analysis work, an overview framework is useful to  place these in context and help determine the most appropriate technique for each  individual situation. In this chapter we have set out a Business Analysis Process Model  as a framework within which both standard modelling techniques and organisational  templates can be used. This approach also incorporates the principles of Requirements  Engineering to highlight best practice when defining system requirements.  AN APPROACH TO PROBLEM SOLVING One of the requirements of business managers is that business analysts examine the  entire business area and take a thoughtful, even creative, approach to developing ideas  for solutions. Creative problem solving is vital in the business world as, increasingly,  organisations need to develop innovative ideas in order to respond to changes in the  business environment including actions from competitors.",1085,160,271.25
86,"However, many people find  this difficult; often because they feel under pressure to produce ideas very quickly. In this  context, Isaksen and Treffinger’s (1985) original creative problem solving model, shown  in Figure 4.1, provides a useful framework for understanding problems and developing  creative solutions, particularly as the model emphasises the need to investigate and  analyse rather than leap to quick, possibly premature, solutions.  This model proposes an approach that may be applied usefully to business analysis.  In this section we describe the implications and suggestions the model has for you  as a business analyst. The first stage, mess finding, is where we often begin when  undertaking a problem investigation.",738,109,184.5
86,"In business analysis this stage is concerned with  finding out about the complexity of the problem situation. Many problems are poorly  defined or ambiguous, and each problem situation is likely to be complex and contain  various issues and concerns. In other words, there is likely to be a ‘mess’ and different  situations will have different components to that mess. Identifying this as the starting  point in this model helps to emphasise that you need to gain some understanding about  the complete situation before diving into options and solutions. The rich picture diagram,  described in Chapter 5, is particularly useful to help document and analyse the ‘mess’ in  problematic business situations.",705,110,176.25
86,Rich pictures do not use a defined notation set and the  flexibility this offers enables us to use them to represent any situation. Mind maps and  fishbone diagrams are also described in Chapter 5 and are similarly helpful. 56,226,39,56.5
87,"THE BUSINESS ANALYSIS PROCESS MODEL Figure 4.1  A problem solving model (after Isaksen and Treffinger,1985) Figur e 4.1 Data finding, the second stage of the model, is concerned with analysing the opinions,  concerns, knowledge and ideas uncovered in the previous stage, in order to identify  where this information can be quantified and supporting data obtained. It is often  useful to examine the rich picture, mind map or fishbone diagram to clarify our thinking  about the situation. It is particularly important to consider which information is factual  and which is based on opinion. This can help lead us to the aspects that we can, and  should, verify and also emphasises the need to divorce opinion, whilst useful, from fact.  Chapter 5 explains some techniques that will help you to obtain quantitative data, such  as surveys and activity sampling.",858,137,214.5
87,"Problem finding then uses the work of the previous two stages to help uncover the  heart of the problem. We now know the complexity of the situation facing us and have  been able to quantify some data whilst appreciating that other information represents  personal views or opinions. We may have been presented with a statement of the  problem at the outset but at this point, having carried out the previous two stages, it is  important to revisit this in order to understand fully where the problems lie. Finding the  right problem to solve is often a necessary part of business analysis, as analysts are  often pointed at symptoms and they have to dig deeper in order to find out where the  real problems lie. So, these first three stages are concerned with understanding the problem and they  provide a structure for doing this.",832,143,208.0
87,"The next two stages focus on developing solutions. First, there is idea finding during which business analysts try to generate a wide range  of ideas. Analysts often use brainstorming approaches to uncover ideas but this can  be difficult as it requires a group to generate ideas ‘cold’. Sometimes this works but  often different approaches need to be used with brainstorming to stimulate ideas and  so during this stage it may be useful to use some creative thinking techniques. Two  examples of techniques that can provide stimuli for creative ideas are ‘Assumption  57",571,92,142.75
88,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Reversal’ – where assumptions about a situation are listed and reversed – and ‘Random  Words or Pictures’ – where unrelated words or pictures are used to generate different  ideas about a situation. More information about these techniques can be found in the  creative thinking texts mentioned in the references and further reading. Once some ideas have been identified, they can be evaluated and we can focus on those  that could provide solutions to the problem(s). This is the solution finding stage and it  is significant that this stage appears so late in the model. Business analysts are often  expected to deliver solutions quickly, yet here we can see that it is important to resist  the pressure to develop solutions at too early a stage; there are other aspects that  need to be considered first.",824,136,206.0
88,"Also, Isaksen and Treffinger (1985) stress the importance  of identifying criteria to help evaluate potential solutions and this would not be possible  without the earlier work. Therefore, it is important to work through the earlier stages  as they will help you to develop better, more appropriate solutions that will be more  beneficial for the business situation. The final stage in the model is acceptance finding which is concerned with gaining  business acceptance of the solution. This aspect is critical to the success of any change  project. Chapter 8 considers the importance of ensuring changes align with the business  architecture.",644,99,161.0
88,Chapter 9 considers how the feasibility of proposed solutions may be  evaluated and how a robust business case may be made in order to obtain approval  from the business.  THE BUSINESS ANALYSIS PROCESS MODEL One of the aspects that makes business analysis work so interesting is the range and  nature of business analysis projects. The business systems under consideration can  be very varied; for a particular project business analysts may need to apply several  techniques and analyse a number of different stakeholder views. Sometimes the  project may be to investigate a problematic part of the organisation and produce outline  recommendations for ways forward. Other projects may require the business analyst  to analyse and document specific business or system requirements.,781,119,195.25
88,"So, the challenges  faced in developing a process model are to offer something that is sufficiently flexible  while providing a framework that will help people to carry out their work. The process  model shown in Figure 4.2 is intended to meet these challenges. Figure 4.2  The Business Analysis Process Model Figure 4.2 58",323,53,80.75
89,"THE BUSINESS ANALYSIS PROCESS MODEL The top stripe of the process model shows the importance of understanding the business  context. Within this context, we need to be aware of the Mission, Objective, Strategy  and Tactics (MOST), as described in Chapter 3. However, there is a more fundamental  aspect of which we should also be aware and this concerns the underlying values of  the organisation. For example, does the organisation genuinely value aspects such  as quality and customer service? Or, are low costs more important?",529,84,132.25
89,"Does it comply  where necessary with legislation regarding equality of access or really embrace the  importance of accessibility for all? Recognising the values of the organisation and being  aware of the MOST, will help us to have a clearer understanding of the stakeholders and  their priorities. The process model sets out the key stages for a business analysis project with  each stage representing the areas that need to be considered. However, it should  be noted that whilst some projects may require a detailed exploration of all of  the stages, other projects may focus on a subset of the model, possibly just one  stage. One of the most important aspects of a business analysis project is to decide  what the focus is and which areas need to be investigated.",768,128,192.0
89,"For example, on some  projects the focus may be to explore possible improvements to how part of the  organisation works. In this case, we might begin by examining all of the current  working practices, including the staffing and job roles, and the work may focus on  analysing and evaluating the options for the future business system. Another project  may focus on the IT system needs and whilst understanding the situation and all of  the stakeholder perspectives is important, the potential for the use of IT to improve  the business system will dominate the analysis. The rest of this chapter describes  the stages of this process model. INVESTIGATE SITUATION This stage is concerned with uncovering issues and problems.",724,117,181.0
89,"The terms of reference  for the project, or possibly a more detailed project initiation document, are needed in  order to set out the context within which the business analysis work will take place. The  OSCAR mnemonic can be very useful when clarifying the terms of reference if none  exist. This stands for the following: Objectives		 The business and project objectives to be achieved. Scope	 	 The area of the business to be investigated and the required  deliverables. Constraints	 The time, budgetary and policy constraints within which the  work must be conducted.",574,90,143.5
89,"Authority	 	 The person who is responsible for receiving the deliverables  and agreeing that 	 the work has been completed. Resources	 The resources, both human and physical, available to the  project. A key area for the analyst is to clarify the objectives of the study and tailor the approach  accordingly – often a task that requires a good deal of skill. During the initial period of  business analysis work the analyst may be presented with a statement of ‘the problem’  59",480,79,120.0
90,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS but this statement may not be correct. It is important to investigate the situation  further in order to determine where the real problems lie, and ensure that symptoms  of the problems are not confused with the real issues. It is also vital that the analyst  does not make false assumptions or accept all of the information provided without  question. To perform this work effectively, it is important that the business analyst  has an understanding of the business context during the investigation stage. Once the  analyst has begun to understand the situation and clarify some of the ambiguity that  exists, it will be necessary to create documentation recording the findings.",697,111,174.25
90,"This will be  required for future reference and also to help other members of the team understand  the situation.  Investigation techniques There are many investigative approaches that business analysts can use and these are  explored in detail in Chapter 5. It is important that we consider the range of possible  investigative approaches and choose those that are most appropriate to the work in  hand.  The level of detail required during this stage may vary considerably depending on  the focus of the business analysis work. If the analyst is trying to gain an overall  appreciation of the business area, for example, to identify the key stakeholders and  acquire an understanding of their views and opinions, or to appreciate the nature  of the work and the range of people and skills, then often the techniques used will  be those that provide an overall perspective and generalised view; interviewing,  observation and workshops would be particularly useful.",966,153,241.5
90,"However, if the work is  concerned with eliciting more detailed information such as data requirements or  the flow of a business process then the most appropriate fact-finding techniques  are those that focus on the detail such as document analysis, scenario analysis  or prototyping. Much of the information gained during the initial investigation may  be subjective, so should be quantified through more detailed analysis. In this case,  techniques such as record searching or surveys may be very useful in order to  quantify some of the information put forward. Documenting business situations There are a number of useful techniques for documenting and visualising the initial  investigation of a business system. It is typical that a high-level overview of the situation  will be required during the initial investigation, particularly where the issues are complex  and originate from different causes.",907,136,226.75
90,"As we mentioned earlier, a ‘rich picture’ can be very  useful in capturing the essence of a situation. An alternative, but similar approach, is  the ‘mind map’; this also allows for a degree of structuring of the information. Fishbone  diagrams can also be very useful during investigation as they help to uncover the root  causes of problems. These techniques are described in further detail in Chapter 5. Other  techniques may also be useful where specific issues have been identified.",487,79,121.75
90,"For example,  if there are issues with the business processes then process modelling (described in  Chapter 7) will be relevant. 60",131,21,32.75

Many stakeholders hold very strong views about why problems exist,  what needs to be done to improve the situation and where the focus of the business  system should lie. Where some of the issues arise from differences in stakeholder views  it is vital that they are explored and where possible taken into account when making  recommendations for the way forward. Stakeholder identification and analysis Every business situation will affect a range of individuals and organisations. Among this  group there will be people or groups with varying levels of interest and power.",1768,261,442.0
91,Some  61,8,2,2.0
92,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS stakeholders may be directly affected by any recommendations and may hold strong  views on how the systems and working practices should be changed. Others may be  affected only indirectly and, whilst having opinions, may be less concerned about the  nature of the new system. The range of possible stakeholders and mechanisms for  stakeholder analysis and management are discussed in detail in Chapter 6. Stakeholder perspectives Stakeholders often have different views on what is important about a business system  and, as a result, have different ideas about the improvements that are needed. These  views are often contradictory and can lead to hidden agendas, conflicts and inconsistent  priorities.",721,108,180.25
92,"As business analysts it is important that we are aware of the potential for  such conflicts and are alert to situations where these might arise. We can often detect  where the different stakeholder conflicts might originate by considering the underlying  set of values and beliefs they hold. For example, we might reflect on what an individual  stakeholder considers to be the main focus of the business system and, critically, why  this is the case. Understanding these values and beliefs allows the analyst to approach  issues and problems from an informed position and hence have an improved chance of  resolving the situation. Chapter 6 considers the importance of analysing stakeholders  and their perspectives and explains how they may be analysed by considering the  world view of each stakeholder.",805,127,201.25

Business activity modelling The stakeholder perspectives can be analysed further by considering the business  activities that would be required to fulfil a particular perspective. This approach,  developed from Checkland’s work, and extended by Wilson (1990), allows analysts to  build a conceptual model of a business system as envisaged by a particular stakeholder.  For example, where a manager believes an events organisation should focus on quality  then there would be an emphasis on activities such as: yy the recruitment and development of highly skilled staff; yy the introduction of customer-focused processes; yy monitoring of customer satisfaction levels. An alternative view could be that the focus should be on ‘no frills’ events and in this  system the emphasis would be on the following activities: yy keeping costs low;  yy monitoring the number of attendees at events.",983,147,245.75
92," This approach allows business analysts to consider where the priorities lie and what  the focus of the new, improved business system should be. One stakeholder’s view may  take precedence over the others or several models may be synthesised to provide an  agreed business activity model.

93,"THE BUSINESS ANALYSIS PROCESS MODEL Stage summary Objectives The objective of this stage is to take stock of the range of stakeholder perspectives  about the business system under investigation. These perspectives may then be  analysed to uncover stakeholder values and beliefs, and developed into business  activity models. However, where there is a narrow remit for the business analysis work,  for example if we are concerned primarily with improving a particular process, while it  will be important to identify and manage the stakeholders, consideration of the entire  business system may be beyond the scope of the business analysis work.

94,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS view is compared with a desired, future or ‘to be’ system. This method contrasts with  the traditional, more systematic approach to business or systems improvement where  new features are added on to an existing set of procedures or IT system functions. With  gap analysis the emphasis is on understanding where we want to be and, by looking at  where we are now, identify what needs to change to take us there. Analysing activities Where you have developed a business activity model from a stakeholder perspective,  this can be used to carry out a detailed analysis of the desired business system by  examining each activity in turn. This analysis allows us to identify where there are issues  that need to be addressed in any solution that we recommend.",773,129,193.25
94,"As the model provides  a conceptual picture of the desired business activities it allows the business analyst to  see where the current business system is lacking. When examining the model, the range  and extent of the gaps found will vary from activity to activity. Some activities may be  in place and operating satisfactorily. However, others may be inadequate in the current  business system and some may not exist at all. There may be good support for the  activity from the organisation’s information systems or this may be poor and in need of  improvement.",563,93,140.75
94,"Identifying the gaps at this level will help us to determine the potential for  change to the business system and the degree to which this is required.  The business activity model may identify a range of areas to be considered in the light of  the current business situation. However, it is possible that some aspects may be beyond  the scope of the business analysis work. Analysing business processes At a more detailed level, gap analysis focuses on the business processes that are  applied within the business system. Whereas the activities modelled on the business  activity model show a conceptual view of what activities should be within the desired  business system, the business process models allow us to consider how the work is  carried out.",754,124,188.5
94,"Therefore, the analysis is conducted at a more specific level of detail and,  rather than being conceptual, is much closer to the physical reality of the business  system. A business process is initiated by a business event, which is sometimes called  a ‘trigger’, and concludes when the goal of the process has been achieved. This view of  the business situation cuts across departments and job roles in order to show a more  results-oriented view that is focused on meeting customer needs. The approach we  take to this work is to model the current business process and then to consider possible  changes to the process before finalising the required process. Hence, we develop a  current or ‘as is’ model that provides a basis for developing the required or ‘to be’  model.",776,130,194.0

Where the  changes are to the business processes, the modelling techniques described in Chapter  7 should be used to define how the new processes should look. If the recommendations  include the implementation of redesigned processes, this is likely to require changes to  the structure of the organisation and the job roles, plus development of the staff skills.  It is sometimes the case that the improvements to the business system can be made  through limited changes such as improved job definitions or additional training for the  staff.",1247,185,311.75

If the requirements are not documented  clearly then this is likely to cause problems not only during the development of the  system but also once the system has been implemented.

While they will be  making use of background research, workshops, one-to-one interviews and quantitative  methods of verification of data, they must also use diagnostic tools for understanding  a problem area, and different approaches to documenting their findings, according to  the focus. This chapter will look at a range of techniques used to investigate business  areas and document the findings. The assumption behind this chapter is that the analyst will be responsible for performing  a broad study that begins with a general understanding of the situation, then produces  a diagnosis of the underlying causes and subsequently understands the requirements  for a solution. The terms of reference for most analysis studies will be significantly  narrower than that; nevertheless, all the techniques to be described in this chapter will  be useful at one time or another.",1098,169,274.5
102,"We advocate a toolbox approach to analysis rather than  a strict checklist method, and the more tools available, the more flexible and responsive  the analyst can be. PRIOR RESEARCH When an analyst first approaches their client organisation, (or division or department),  they should first spend time gathering as much background information as they  can. There are various sources available, but the internet has made access to such  background information much simpler than before.  Study website This is the quickest and simplest way to get a view of what the organisation does, what  its values are, how it brands itself and how it wants to be perceived. Depending upon  the nature of the organisation the website should provide access to information about  the products and services, opportunities to interact with the site and give feedback, and  offer details about the company.",885,140,221.25

It may be worth exploring customer reviews on other sites  such as those that review hotels or restaurants.  One useful inference from the design of the website is how the company views its place  strategically, in terms of the balance between the cost and the perceived quality of its  products. The design of the website will often give an indication of the level of quality  it aims at: primary colours, flashing icons, liberal use of exclamation marks and free  use of suggestive words like ‘Bargain!’",644,105,161.0

Interpreting a website in this way can provide an early insight  into the business imperatives for the organisation. We can also evaluate the ease of navigating around the site, placing an order or making  an enquiry. These things will give an idea of the level of professionalism of the site  and expected standards of technology presentation and achievement. This in turn can  provide clues about the technological maturity of the company – is the technology  aligned to the business intention, or are the developers showing off their skills at the  expense of the company’s message?",747,118,186.75
103,"Study company reports If we are approaching a commercial company in the role of an external consultant, it  is useful to look at company reports to confirm the health of the company. Companies  with limited liability are required to file statutory documents reporting on their financial  position. For example, UK companies are required to file the Income Statement (Profit  and Loss Account) and Balance Sheet with Companies House, from where they may be  accessed by the public. These documents can provide much rich information about the  levels of debt, liquidity, gearing, trends in growth or stagnation over the previous years,  and a first insight into where there may be problems. The shareholders’ reports will also  set out the future direction of the company as agreed by the Directors, and state the  targets and aims for the next year.",848,138,212.0

Studying these reports at the outset of a project can also save later unnecessary effort  and avoid financial loss. As an example, following an invitation to carry out consultancy  work for a new client, an examination of the company’s entry at Companies House  revealed that it was about to be suspended for non-submission of accounts over the  previous two years. A failure to carry out this research could have ended with unpaid  invoices and wasted effort.

For example, a study might  be to investigate an area of concern, diagnose a weakness in the business processes or  compile the requirements for a new system. After the prior research has been done, the  analyst needs to consider how to conduct the more detailed investigation. There will be  a variety of techniques available, depending upon the size of the domain in question, its  location, the number of stakeholders to be consulted, and the nature of the information  to be ascertained.  The techniques can be categorised broadly as qualitative, understanding what is needed,  and quantitative, concerned with volumes and frequencies.",723,111,180.75
104,"Qualitative techniques can  be further broken down into one-to-one sessions and collaborative sessions.

The last point can be the hardest part of an interview, as we are asking business users  to think beyond their experience. They may offer vaguely worded suggestions and so  the skill of the interviewer is needed to assess the implications of the initial suggestions  and draw out more detailed information.

This means that we need to appreciate what they do, their concerns and what they want  from any new processes or systems. For their part, the users need to have confidence in  the analysts, to know that we are aware of their concerns, are professional, and are not  leaping to implement a solution that overlooks the user’s own needs and worries. Taking  time to form good relationships early on in the project will increase the opportunities to  understand the context and details of the business users’ concerns and needs.  The second major benefit is that the interview can yield important information.",821,136,205.25
105,"The focus  of the information will vary depending upon the needs of the project but will usually  include details about the current operations, including difficulties in carrying out the  work, and will help with the identification of requirements for the new business system.

The first of these is recommended  for the initial interview with a particular stakeholder for the following reasons: yy This is the interviewee’s own territory where he or she is likely to feel at ease  and less apprehensive.",627,102,156.75
108,"Meeting interviewees at their place of work also sends  a signal of respect. yy The interviewer has an opportunity to informally observe the working  environment, the culture of the organisation and the frequency and nature of  any interruptions. yy The interviewee should have all relevant source documents, reports and  screens to hand, instead of having to take additional actions after the interview. For subsequent meetings and interviews the two parties can agree on a mutually  convenient location. The analyst should have established a good working relationship  by the end of the first interview session, so the venue is of less concern.",646,101,161.5
108,"Conducting the interview It is important to structure interviews if the maximum amount of information is to be  elicited using a basic structure of introduction, body of interview and close, as shown  in Figure 5.2.  Figure 5.2  The structure of an interview Figu re 5. 2 The introduction In addition to making personal introductions, it is also important that the analyst  makes sure the interviewee understands the purpose of the project in general and the  interview in particular. Ideally, the interviewee should know this but such knowledge  cannot be relied upon. Explaining the context helps to put the interviewee at ease and  will help them to provide the relevant information.",686,110,171.5
108,It is important to make sure that the  interviewee has received the agenda and that any points they wish to raise are clarified. 78,131,24,32.75
109,"INVESTIGATION TECHNIQUES Body of the interview The main part of the interview is where the facts and issues are uncovered. It is useful to  think about how you are going to structure this. A good approach is to begin by obtaining  a context for the information this interviewee can provide. This context will usually cover  the responsibilities of the interviewee, and their range of responsibilities. Once we have  a context, we can structure the interview by examining each relevant area separately  and in detail.",516,84,129.0
109,"This will enable us to consider the issues, and the impact of those issues,  in each area and to uncover any specific problems and requirements. It is essential to take notes during the interview. Even if you have an excellent memory,  you will not remember everything discussed during the interview. If the purpose of the  interview is to understand a current procedure, a good way of taking notes can be to  draw a diagram, such as a flow chart. If the purpose is to discuss a number of broader  issues, including needs for the future, a mind map is a useful way of noting what has  been said, and also, if drawn up as part of the preparation, provides an easy visual check  on what has been covered and further areas for discussion.",735,133,183.75
109,"This can be important as  however well you have structured your questions in your preparation, conversations  always take unexpected loops and diversions. It is important to allow the discussion to  detour into other areas, as it helps to gain further insights. In these circumstances, using  a diagram to help keep the interview structure in mind can be invaluable. In some situations it is appropriate to use a portable digital recorder to capture the  interview in preference to writing notes. This can be very useful to ensure that all of the  details are captured.",569,93,142.25
109,"However, many people feel self-conscious when being recorded  and the analyst must be sensitive to the interviewee’s comfort. It should also be  remembered that using a recorder will involve a considerable overhead: it can take up  to an hour to transcribe ten minutes worth of conversation. Closure It is important to close the interview formally. The analyst should: yy Summarise the points covered and the actions agreed. yy Explain what happens next, both with regard to the particular interview and the  project.",517,82,129.25
109,"We will usually want to advise the interviewee that we will send them a  copy of the written-up notes so that they can check for any errors. yy Ask the interviewee how any further contact should be made; managing the  interviewee’s expectations of future behaviour can be extremely useful and will  be invaluable if we need any additional information or clarifications at a later  point. This also serves to keep the door open for a future interview session if  required.  Following up the interview It is always a good idea to write up the notes of the interview as soon as possible –  ideally straight away and usually by the next day. If it is not possible to write up the notes  immediately you will find this task easier if you read through them immediately after the  interview, and extend them where they are unclear.",824,145,206.0

OBSERVATION Observing the workplace, and the staff carrying out their work, especially early in an  investigation, is very useful in obtaining information about the business environment and  the work practices. There are several different approaches to observation, depending  upon the level and focus of interest: formal observation, shadowing, protocol analysis  and ethnographic studies. These are all explained in more detail below.",597,86,149.25
110," It is important that before any work is observed, the person being observed should be  reassured that the objective is to understand the task not to judge their performance.  Care is needed if you want to observe a unionised work-site to ensure that approval is  also gained from the trade union representatives and that any protocols are observed. Advantages and disadvantages of observation The views of the stakeholders involved in a project may have been sought during  interviews but, to really obtain a feel for the situation, the analyst needs to see the  workplace and business practices. Apart from collecting actual facts it is also possible  to clarify areas of tacit information and hence increase understanding. This has the  following advantages: yy We obtain a much better understanding of the problems and difficulties faced  by the business users.",865,138,216.25
110,"yy Seeing a task performed will help us prepare appropriate questions for a more  in-depth interview with the person responsible for that task. yy It will help us to devise workable solutions that are more likely to be acceptable  to the business. Conversely, being observed can be rather unnerving and the old saying ‘you change  what you observe’ needs to be factored into the approach taken and resultant findings.  Formal observation Formal observation involves watching a specific task being performed. There is a danger  here of being shown just the standard practice without any of the everyday variances,  but it is still a useful tool to understand the environment.",674,109,168.5
110,"It is important that the staff  members being observed are prepared beforehand and are aware that this is in order  to understand the task not, as many will fear, in order to assess their competence and  performance. Self-consciousness can influence how the staff member performs and a  lack of prior notice will serve to accentuate this problem. If the staff members perceive  the observer as having been sent by management, they are more likely to perform the  task according to the rulebook, rather than how it has evolved over time. It is perfectly acceptable to ask people being observed about the sequence of steps they  are following, so long as: 80",656,111,164.0
111,"INVESTIGATION TECHNIQUES yy The question does not sound critical of the way the person is working, either in  words or tone of voice. yy It does not distract from their performance of the job. The analyst must position  themselves in such a way that they can see clearly all that is happening, but do  not get in the way or otherwise interfere with the task. To get full value from the observation, it is beneficial to watch the staff members perform  the task several times in order to understand the standard sequence, any possible  exception situations and how they are handled, timings for the task and any ergonomic  factors or physical working conditions that may enhance or hinder performance. Physical tasks such as handling goods in a warehouse, or despatching consignments  to customers are clearly more susceptible to formal observation than, say, data entry.",870,144,217.5
111," However, observing more sedentary tasks, such as manning a customer services  helpline, or telesales can still provide a lot of useful information, for example, to  understand where problems are arising or to elicit requirements for a new system.  When watching a physical task, it can be helpful to sketch the layout of the workplace  and where the various actors in the task are stationed. Having such a sketch will help  with later reflection and analysis of the results. Protocol analysis Protocol analysis involves asking the users to carry out a task and describe each step  they perform. It is a way of eliciting information about the skills required to complete  a task that cannot be described in words alone.",719,119,179.75
111,"The higher the level of unconscious  skill involved in a task, the harder it is to explain verbally. Protocol analysis uses a  ‘performing and describing’ approach which can be extremely helpful for analysts to  gain greater understanding. A similar approach may be used to train a new member of  staff or someone unfamiliar with a task. For example, rather than teaching new learner  drivers in a classroom before they try driving on the roads, the drivers learn by watching  the task being both performed and explained simultaneously, and they then perform it  for themselves.  Shadowing Shadowing involves following a user for a period, such as one or two days, to find out  what a particular job entails.",708,117,177.0
111,"This is a powerful way to understand a specific user role.  When shadowing, we can ask for explanations of aspects such as how the work is done,  the information used, or the workflow sequence, so it is a good way of clarifying what the  individual actually does to perform the role. It can also be very helpful to uncover some  of the taken-for-granted aspects of the work. The longer the analyst spends shadowing  a user, the greater the opportunity to build rapport and the better chance there is of  capturing the additional details that may not be elicited during a single 45-minute  interview. Shadowing key staff is a useful approach during the requirements definition  work, since it provides a visual context for processes described during interviews or  workshops.",774,128,193.5

112,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Ethnographic studies Ethnographic study is often beyond the budget of most business analysis projects but  could yield high returns if conducted. It is derived from the discipline of anthropology  and involves spending an extended period of time – from a few weeks up to several  months – in the target environment. This approach enables the analyst to gain a  thorough understanding of the business system as, in a short space of time, the  business community becomes used to the analyst’s presence and behaves more  naturally and authentically. The main value gained from ethnography is an appreciation  of intangible aspects such as the organisational culture in which any proposed change  must be embedded, including recognising where both formal and informal power and  influences reside. This approach can also be very useful when analysing complex  business systems, for example, where the staff members are highly expert in conducting  their work and the business rules are difficult to assimilate.",1024,158,256.0

113,"INVESTIGATION TECHNIQUES Although workshops are extremely valuable, there are some disadvantages to using  them including: yy Workshops can be time-consuming to organise. For example it is not always  easy to get all the necessary people together at the same time. yy If the workshop is not carefully facilitated, it may happen that a forceful  participant will dominate the discussion. In extreme cases, such a participant  may be able to impose a decision because the other members of the group feel  disempowered and unable to raise their objections. yy It can be difficult to ensure that the participants have the required level of  authority – which sometimes means that decisions are reversed after the  workshop has ended.",729,116,182.25
113,"Gaining the advantages, and avoiding the disadvantages, is only possible if a workshop  is well organised and run; the means of achieving this is discussed in the rest of this  section.  Preparing for the workshop The success or failure of a workshop session depends in large part upon the preparatory  work done by its facilitator and its business sponsor for the workshop. They should  spend time before the event planning the following areas:  yy The objective of the workshop: this has to be an objective that can be achieved  within the time constraints of the workshop. If this is a sizeable objective the  duration of the workshop will need to reflect this, possibly running to several  days. In this case, the objective should be broken into sub-objectives, each of  which is the subject of an individual workshop session.",830,138,207.5
113,"For example, a two-day  workshop may be broken into four sessions, each of which is focused upon a  particular sub-objective. yy The people to be invited to participate in the workshop: it is important that  all stakeholders interested in the objective should be invited to attend or be  represented. It is the facilitator’s responsibility to ensure that all stakeholders  are able to contribute, which may mean performing many of the key tasks by  using breakout groups or other techniques, and reporting back to a plenary  session to collate the individual results. It can also be useful to consider in  advance, the personalities, concerns and viewpoints of those to be invited to  the workshop.  yy The structure of the workshop and the techniques to be used: these need to be  geared towards achieving the defined objective and should take into account the  nature of the group, the needs of the attendees and their preferred participation  style.",952,155,238.0

Facilitating the workshop The workshop should start by discussing the objective and endeavouring to secure  the participants’ buy-in. Where difficulties are anticipated, it may be useful to invite a  senior manager or the project sponsor to open the workshop in order to define some  ground rules and set the expectations for behaviour. This also helps to demonstrate a  commitment to the process underway. During the workshop, the facilitator needs to  ensure that the issues are discussed, views are aired and progress is made towards  achieving the stated objective.",745,118,186.25
114,"The discussion may range widely but the facilitator  needs to ensure that it does not go completely off the track and that everyone has an  opportunity to express his or her concerns and opinions.  A record needs to be kept of the key points emerging from the discussion. This is often  done by the facilitator keeping a record on a flipchart, but it is better practice to appoint  someone else to take the role of scribe during the workshop. The presence of a scribe  allows the facilitator to concentrate fully on the process and the attendees, watching  non-verbal behaviour to identify members of the group who may be feeling unhappy or  unable to make their points. If the facilitator is spending a lot of time writing or drawing,  such cues can be easily missed.",768,134,192.0

115,"INVESTIGATION TECHNIQUES yy Brainstorming (sometimes known as idea storming), where the participants  are asked to call out ideas about a given item, all of which are written on a  flipchart or whiteboard. It is important that all of the suggestions can be seen  by everyone taking part as this allows the participants to build on each other’s  ideas.

115,"Round robin discussions provide everyone with an opportunity  to speak without fear of interruption or being ignored. yy Brainwriting which has similarities with brainstorming but requires participants  to write down ideas. Each person writes an idea on a sheet of paper and then  puts it in the middle of the table. Everyone then takes another sheet with an idea  already written on it, writes down another idea and then returns the paper to  the centre. This continues until there are no more ideas being generated.",517,85,129.25
115,"This  approach is useful because it overcomes the problem of ‘shouting out’ while  still enabling everyone to build on the ideas of the other workshop attendees. yy Sticky (post-it) note exercises also involve writing down ideas but in this case,  the participants work individually or in pairs. Each individual or pair writes  down their suggestions – one per sticky note – and, once everyone has stopped  writing, displays them to the group, usually by sticking them on a wall or board.  Once all of the suggestions have been displayed, those that are similar are  grouped together and broader themes are developed.  yy Stepwise refinement is where we take a statement or idea and keep asking  ‘why?,",702,116,175.5
115,"why?’ to every answer until we think we’ve got to the heart of a problem,  idea or situation.  yy Smaller ‘break-out’ or ‘syndicate’ groups, where specific aspects are  considered and then reported back to the larger group. This is a powerful way  to manage a larger workshop, particularly where there is a range of skills and  knowledge. It can also be useful for each break-out group to have its own sub- facilitator.",419,72,104.75
115,"Many visualisation techniques are suitable for use in a workshop. Visual approaches  are quick to understand and to explain, and they help workshop participants to access  the information being captured. Several useful pictorial or diagrammatic techniques  are explored during the course of this book and include process models, data models,  use case diagrams, rich pictures and mind maps; some of these are discussed later  in this chapter.

Hothouse workshop A hothouse workshop is a specific type of workshop that applies Lean and Agile  principles to a business problem.",730,115,182.5
116,"In Agile environments a project, or phase of a project,  may be initiated by a hothouse workshop, bringing the business and development teams  together to solve business problems and using prototypes to define the functionality and  scope of the solution. The business participants are ideally at executive level. This idea  derives from the work of James Martin at IBM in the 1980s, when a Joint Requirements  Planning (JRP) workshop brought senior executives and analysts together to define  functionality, scope and timeframes for new developments. Hothouses combine this JRP  approach with Lean techniques. As its name suggests, it is a very intense experience,  often with participants working into the night, to produce prototype models of how the  new solution might look.",779,120,194.75
116,"Hothouses typically take place over 2–3 days and are primarily  for innovation projects rather than simple administration systems or enhancements to  existing systems. The workshop group is typically split into smaller teams who each  develop a prototype solution during a series of iterations. At the end of each iteration, the  output is reviewed and feedback given which is used during the next iteration and so on.  The hothouse may be run as a competition between the groups. Ultimately, the outcome  should be a prototype solution to a business problem accompanied by additional  analyses of the corresponding metrics, processes, costs and benefits required to enable  the delivery of the full solution.",709,110,177.25
116,"Focus groups Focus groups tend to be concerned with business and market research. They bring  together a group of people with a common interest to discuss a topic. While such a  meeting has similarities with a workshop, it is not the same thing. A focus group could  be used to understand people’s attitudes to any current shortcomings with the business  system, for example, the reason why customers are unhappy with a service, or why  the website is failing to turn hits into sales.

SCENARIOS Scenario analysis is essentially telling the story of a task or transaction. Scenarios are  useful when analysing or redesigning business processes as they help both the staff  member and the analyst to work through the steps required of a business process or  system.",877,142,219.25
117,"This will enable them to think through and visualise the steps more clearly. A  scenario description will include the business event that triggers the transaction, the  set of actions that have to be completed in order to achieve a successful outcome and  other aspects such as the actor responsible for carrying out the task, the preconditions  and the postconditions. The preconditions are the characteristics of the business or  state of the IT system that must be true for the scenario to begin. Postconditions are the  characteristics that must be true following the conclusion of the scenario.  One of the key strengths of scenarios is that they provide a framework for discovering  the exceptions that require alternative paths to be followed when carrying out the  task.",778,125,194.5
117,"The transition from each step to the next provides an opportunity to analyse what  else might happen or be true. This analysis often uncovers additional information or  tacit knowledge.

Where this is the case, you will find it easier to analyse the scenarios  if each of the alternative paths is considered as a separate scenario. Figure 5.4 shows an overview approach to developing scenarios and includes the  following steps: yy Identify the task or interaction to be modelled as a scenario and the trigger, or  event, that causes that interaction to take place. yy Identify the steps that will be carried out during the usual progress of the  interaction, and the flow of these steps. yy Define the control conditions; the conditions that must be met in order to move  from one step to the next, following the typical sequence of steps.",851,141,212.75
118,"yy Identify the alternative paths that would be required to handle the situations  where the control conditions are not met. Figure 5.4  Process for developing scenarios Figure 5 .4 This approach establishes a default path for the scenario that assumes no complications  and everything running as expected. This path is often known as the main success  scenario, or sometimes, the ‘happy day’ scenario. Scenarios are powerful when eliciting  information, because they break down each of the default steps to ask the questions  ‘What needs to be true to continue with this path?’ and ‘At this point, what might happen  instead?’",627,100,156.75
118,Once the alternatives have been uncovered the analyst can then ask the  question ‘What should we do if this happens or if this is true?’  Consider an example scenario where a customer wishes to place an order via the  telephone.  The precondition might be that for the process to happen the sales clerk is already  logged in to the sales system. The default steps for the telesales clerk could then be: i.	 enter customer reference number; ii. 	 confirm customer details; 88,474,81,118.5
119,"INVESTIGATION TECHNIQUES iii. 	 record order items; iv. 	 accept payment; v.	 advise customer of delivery date. In order for this scenario to flow in the sequence shown, the control conditions to go  from step (i) to step (ii), step (ii) to step (iii), and so on must be true. For example, the  order items recorded in step (iii) must be in available for step (iv) to take place.",379,67,94.75
119,"However,  if there were insufficient stock then the next step to be followed would not be step (iv)  but an alternative step. There may be several possible actions to be taken following this  alternative step, such as: yy delay an order fulfilment until stock arrives;  yy allocate a substitute item; yy send an order and the customer’s delivery details directly to the supplier. At the (successful) conclusion of the process the postcondition might be: The customer  order has been recorded, stock levels have been adjusted and payment has been received. All of the possibilities should be explored, and documented as alternative paths; these  are termed ‘extensions’ to the default scenario. This process helps to ensure that  all possible situations and exceptions are anticipated, and so help satisfy the law of  requisite variety.",835,132,208.75
119," The example scenario above is described in a generic, abstract manner and some users  may find this approach difficult to apply to the reality of their work. Another possible  approach is known as a ‘concrete’ scenario where a specific narrative or story is  developed and then tested against the requirements already identified to find the gaps.   Here is an example of a concrete scenario for a vehicle parts system: Turpin Coaches calls with an urgent request for 500 Type 2 gaskets. They are a  highly valued – and valuable – customer. They tell the clerk that if we cannot satisfy  them, they must go elsewhere.",617,105,154.25
119,"The stock records show that there are 150 Type 2  gaskets available. Four hundred were allocated to ZED just 30 minutes previously.  Their order will not be processed for another 2 hours. The clerk wishes to amend  the ZED order. Using this concrete scenario, we can see that there is a possible extension in that an  order may be prioritised and amended, giving rise to alternative paths through the  ‘take order’ scenario.",424,72,106.0
119,This will require the analyst to record additional requirements to  those reflected in the ‘happy day’ such as the ability to prioritise orders and to amend  orders already accepted. Concrete scenarios such as this example are extremely useful  in helping to uncover where all the possible extensions lie and can be used during  one-to-one discussions or workshops. It can be helpful for the analyst to present a  prepared ‘happy day’ scenario which is then used as the basis for a discussion. An  89,500,83,125.0
120,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS approach that helps encourage the business stakeholders to contribute wholeheartedly  to this process involves placing them in break-out groups with the instruction to  produce a concrete scenario that will break the ‘happy day’ path. Experience shows  that this instruction sharpens their creativity and produces many valid extensions.  All extensions, and resultant requirements, that are uncovered are then added to the  analysis documentation. Documenting scenarios A popular way of documenting scenario descriptions is to develop use case descriptions  to support use case diagrams. This technique is part of the Unified Modeling Language  (UML) and is a textual method.",693,99,173.25
120,"However, there are a number of graphical methods  for documenting a scenario, such as storyboards, activity diagrams, task models and  decision tree diagrams. USER ANALYSIS It will be evident from the description of scenario modelling that it is important to  understand who the actual users of the proposed system are likely to be and this is  also true of prototyping, which we discuss next. A starting point for understanding  these users is to identify them and give them generic titles, like ‘customer’, ‘supplier’  or ‘regulator’. ( There is clearly a relationship here with stakeholder analysis, which is  discussed in Chapter 6.) However, sometimes these generic titles do not tell us enough about the business  users for us to envisage how and why they might want to use an information system.",802,130,200.5
120," ‘Customer’, for example, is a very broad term that may not capture the different sets  of characteristics displayed by the actual customers of an organisation. A good way of  understanding customers is to create ‘personas’ for them. For example, for a banking  system, we might speculate about three typical customers: George George is a man in his mid-70s who has used the bank for 50 years.  He is not particularly familiar with computers, which he mainly  uses for email to keep in touch with his grandchildren in Australia.  He prefers face-to-face contact with the bank to using its online  services, though be might be enticed to use these if they could be  made intuitive enough.",687,115,171.75
120,"Emma Emma is a professional woman in her thirties who combines a fairly  high-pressure job with looking after two small children. She is very  conversant with computers and prefers to do her banking in spare  moments or late in the evening and rarely, if ever, visits a physical  bank branch. David David is a high-worth businessman who makes extensive use of  the bank’s wealth management services. He is extremely busy but  nevertheless likes to have a personal relationship with his financial  advisers. He demands a high standard of service.",545,89,136.25
120,90,2,1,0.5
121,"INVESTIGATION TECHNIQUES Although these personas are archetypes, they nevertheless help us to envisage why  and how these different customers might want to access the bank’s services and to  design processes and services that are suitable for them. Personas can also be useful  when analysing the users of the business system who have particular accessibility  requirements. For example, we may identify a persona that represents customers who  have a specific disability that we need to understand in order to enable access to the  available business services. PROTOTYPING Prototyping is an important technique for eliciting, analysing, demonstrating and  validating requirements. Analysts often complain that the business users do not know  what they want, and that as a result it is difficult to define the requirements.",823,123,205.75
121,"However,  it can be very difficult for anyone to envisage requirements for the future without  having a sense of what is possible. It is much easier to review a suggested solution and  identify where there are errors or problems. If business users are unclear about their  requirements, prototypes can help them visualise the new system and provide insight  into possible requirements. Using a prototype often releases the blocks to thinking,  and can result in greater understanding and clarity. Prototypes also offer a way of  demonstrating how the new processes or system might work and provide a concrete  basis for evaluation and discussion.",646,102,161.5
121,"Agile software development approaches, such as  DSDM and Scrum, use evolutionary prototyping as an integral part of their development  lifecycle. Prototyping involves building simulations of a process or system in order to review them  with the users to increase understanding about the requirements. There is a range of  approaches to building prototypes. They may be built using the organisation’s system  development environment so that they exactly mirror the future system. Images of the  screens and navigations may be built using presentation software packages such as  Microsoft PowerPoint or they may be mock-ups on paper.",631,94,157.75
121,"A quick but effective form  of prototyping is to use flipchart sheets, pens and packs of sticky notes and work with  the users to develop paper prototypes. This will enable the users to develop screens,  identify navigation paths, define the data they must input or refer to, and prepare lists  of specified values that they know will apply. This approach can also be used to develop  prototypes of a business process. There is a strong link between scenarios and prototyping because scenarios can be used  as the basis for developing prototypes. As well as confirming requirements, prototyping  can often help the users to identify some that they had not considered previously.",678,111,169.5
121, Advantages and disadvantages of prototyping Prototypes are useful for a variety of reasons including: yy to clarify any uncertainty on the part of the analysts and confirm to the user that  we have understood what they asked for;  yy to help the user identify new requirements as they gain an understanding of  what the system will be able to do to support their jobs; 91,372,65,93.0
122,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS yy to demonstrate the look and feel of the proposed system and elicit usability  requirements; yy to validate the system requirements and identify any errors; yy to provide a means of assessing the navigation paths and system performance. Prototyping has a number of hazards, most of which can be avoided by setting clear  objectives for the prototyping exercise and managing the stakeholders’ expectations.  The hazards include: yy The prototyping cycle can spin out of control with endless iterations taking  place.  yy If the purpose of the exercise has not been explained clearly, the users may  think that when they are happy with the mock-up, the system is now complete  and ready for use.  yy User expectations can be raised unnecessarily by failing to mimic the final  appearance of the system, or its performance; a system that is on a stand- alone machine with six dummy data records to search will be more responsive  than a machine that is sharing resources with a thousand other machines on  a national network, and has several million records to access.",1085,178,271.25
122,"If there is likely  to be a delay in the real response time, it is important that you build that into  the prototype.  In an Agile software development environment, prototyping sessions are used to  elicit and analyse requirements, and to construct and test working functionality. The  development work is conducted iteratively, with each iteration using the concept  of a timebox or sprint, typically a predefined number of weeks, within which certain  functionality is delivered. During the timebox, the selected requirements for that delivery  will be validated, coded, tested and released. Contingency is provided by the prioritisation  of the requirements, whereby some are designated at a lower level of priority and may  be postponed to a later timebox if necessary.",773,119,193.25
122,"In this approach, the tension between  time and quality is resolved in favour of time but, because Agile encourages iterative  development, the quality – i.e. the scope of functionality – is merely postponed, not  sacrificed. The prototyping approach allows the business to receive the most critical  pieces of functionality when it needs it, and the less urgent functionality will be delivered  in future iterations. QUANTITATIVE APPROACHES Quantitative approaches are used to obtain data that is needed to quantify the information  that has been provided during interviews, workshops or other qualitative techniques.  Examples of the quantitative data we need could be the following: we might want to  know the number of workers who use a particular system, the number of complaints  received during a set period or the number of orders processed each day. 92",861,134,215.25
123,"INVESTIGATION TECHNIQUES Surveys or questionnaires  Surveys can be useful if we need to get a limited amount of information from a lot of  people and interviewing them individually or running a series of workshops would not  be practical or cost-effective. However, surveys are difficult to design and this has to be  done with care in order to have any possibility of success.  The exact design of a survey depends upon its purpose but there are three main areas  to consider: the heading, classification and data sections. Heading section This is where the purpose of the survey is explained and where instructions for returning  it are given. It is very important that the heading section sets out clearly the rationale  for the survey, the instructions for its return and, where appropriate, any incentive for  completing it.",829,135,207.25
123,"A well-formed heading section will help the respondent to understand  why the information is needed, and as a result will significantly increase the volumes  that are returned. Classification section This is where the details about the respondent are captured. This data provides the basis  for categorising the respondents using predefined analysis criteria, like age, gender  or length of service. Sometimes, surveys are anonymous in that they do not require  identification information about respondents. If this is the case – perhaps because some  controversial questions are included – you must make sure that the respondents cannot  be identified by other means, or confidence in the process will be lost and you will be  unlikely to have a truthful response, if you receive one at all.",792,124,198.0
123,"For example, sometimes  asking for data such as job role, age and gender would enable the identification of a  respondent.  Data section This is where the main body of questions is posed. It is vital to think carefully about  the phrasing of the questions. They must be unambiguous and, ideally, allow for  straightforward answers such as ‘yes/no’, ‘agree/neutral/disagree’ or ‘excellent/ satisfactory/inadequate’. It is always better to structure the questions, where possible,  so that the same range of answers is the same for each group of questions.",554,86,138.5
123,"It is also  important that every set of potential responses is thought through carefully using  the MECE approach. MECE stands for ‘mutually exclusive, completely exhaustive’ and  involves checking each set of defined, alternative responses to make sure that only one  would apply to each respondent and that they cover every situation.  It is important to design surveys carefully if we are to extract meaningful data from  the results. We want to be able to build a summary of the responses, observe patterns  and trends, and draw relevant conclusions; online survey products are often helpful  in supporting this analysis. However, for the conclusions to be meaningful, the survey  must provide clear, unambiguous questions and well-defined responses so that the  data can be collated and analysed properly.",810,125,202.5
123,"A frequent error used in surveys involves  framing questions that are ambiguous. For example, if the question ‘Have you used our  93",132,22,33.0
124,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS website recently?’ was posed and the response was ‘No’, what would that mean? Does  it mean that the respondent: yy Is not interested in our products and services and hence has not visited our  website? yy Did not know we had a website? yy Is not IT-literate and hence has never used this or any other website?",328,59,82.0
124,"yy Last used the website six months ago and does not consider that ‘recently’? In this example, the term ‘recently’ is ambiguous and needs to be quantified.  Alternatively, the question could be rephrased to ask when the website was last used,  and the responses should offer specific time periods that align with the MECE approach. The key drawback with using surveys is that people will find it difficult to find the time  to complete a survey unless it is a topic of interest of significance to them. So, we have  to try to clarify the reasons why the survey exists and why their assistance is needed.",604,106,151.0
124," In some situations, a ‘prize’ or other type of reward may be offered as an inducement  to complete the survey. Ultimately, though, it can be very difficult to obtain the desired  number of responses and that needs to be factored into the design when adopting a  survey approach. Special purpose records Special purpose records are data-gathering forms used by the analyst; the format is  usually decided by the analyst and they are not company records. They can be completed  either by the analyst during an observation session or given to the business users to  complete over a period of time. If the area under investigation were customer services, the analyst may spend a period  of time in the department shadowing one of the staff and compiling a special purpose  record in order to record the number of customer approaches per day, and classify them  – perhaps using a five-bar gate notation – according to whether they are complaints,  queries or returned goods.",970,162,242.5
124,"They may record the nature of customer calls, their duration,  how long it takes to retrieve the data needed to answer the query. Such information  could help the analyst understand the problems with the business process and where  there is scope for improvement.  Another approach is to give the form to the business users to complete as they perform  the task. For example, they could keep a five-bar gate record about how often they need  to transfer telephone calls – this could provide the analyst with information about the  problems with the business process.  There are difficulties with getting people to keep this form of record, chief of which is  that it is easy to forget to record each occurrence.",711,120,177.75
124,"So, if getting people to keep special  purpose records is to be useful, two important criteria have to satisfied: yy The people undertaking the recording must be induced to ‘buy-in’ to the  exercise. This may be by persuading them of the need or benefits, however,  another possibility is that they are instructed to do this by their manager.  94",346,59,86.5
125,"INVESTIGATION TECHNIQUES yy The survey must be realistic about what people can reasonably be expected to  record.  Notwithstanding this, it can still be useful sometimes to get people to keep such records  as they help avoid the problems associated with observation and it can be an effective  use of the analyst’s time.  Activity sampling This is a further quantitative form of observation and can be used when it is necessary  to know how people divide their work time among a range of activities. For example, how  much time is spent on the telephone? How much time spent on reconciling payments?",599,100,149.75
125," How much time on sorting out complaints? One way to find out how people spend their time would be to get them to complete a  special-purpose record but sometimes the results need to have a guaranteed level of  accuracy, for example if they are to be used to build a business case. In situations where  accuracy is important, activity sampling may be used in preference to observation or  special-purpose records. An activity sampling exercise is carried out in five steps: 1. 	 Identify the activities to be recorded.",518,87,129.5
125,"This list should include a ‘not working’  activity as this covers breaks or times away from the desk. It might also  include a ‘not-related’ task, such as first aid or health and safety officer  duties.  2. 	 Decide on the frequency and timings, i.e. when and how often you will record  the activities being undertaken. 3.",322,55,80.5
125,"	 Visit the study group at the times decided upon and record what each group  member is doing.  4. 	 Record the results. 5. 	 After a set period, analyse the results.",166,29,41.5
125,"The results from an activity sampling exercise provide quantifiable data about the  number of times an activity is carried out per day by the group studied. By analysing  that figure against other data, such as the total amount of time available, we are able  to calculate the total length of time spent on that activity and the average time one  occurrence of the activity will take. This information can be useful when developing  business cases and evaluating proposed solutions. Also, it will raise other questions  such as whether the average time is reasonable for this task or whether it indicates a  problem somewhere else in the process. Document analysis Document analysis involves reviewing samples of source documents to uncover  information about an organisation, process or system.",795,126,198.75
125,"For each document, we might analyse: yy How is the document completed? yy Who completes the document? 95",104,18,26.0
126,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS yy Are there any validations or controls on the document? yy Who uses the completed document? yy When is the document used? yy How many are used or produced?  yy How long is the document retained by the organisation, and in what form?",252,45,63.0

126,"Document analysis is useful to supplement other techniques such as interviewing,  workshops and observation. For example, analysing the origin and usage of a document  can prove very enlightening when investigating a process. Samples of completed  documents or system printouts also help to clarify the key items of data used to carry  out the work and can prove an excellent basis for modelling data (see Chapter 12).  SUITABILITY OF TECHNIQUES Some of the techniques described in this chapter are suitable for general investigation  of the problem situation and others more for eliciting requirements for the new system.  Of those suitable for requirements, some are more suitable for a waterfall approach and  others geared more towards Agile developments.",759,116,189.75
126,"Some techniques are suitable in all  situations. Table 5.1 gives a guide to the suitability of these techniques for the different  situations. DOCUMENTING THE CURRENT SITUATION While the investigation of the current situation is going on, the analyst will need to  record the findings, in order to understand the range of issues and the business needs.  Meeting reports should be produced for each interview and workshop so that they can  be agreed with the participants. It is also helpful to use diagrams to document the  business situation.",543,87,135.75
126,"This section suggests five diagrammatic techniques that help the  analyst understand the information that has been obtained and find the root cause of  any problems.  Rich pictures The rich picture technique is one of the few that provide an overview of an entire  business situation.

The technique does not have a fixed notation, but allows the analyst  to use any symbols or notation that are relevant and useful. For this reason the rich  picture can show the human characteristics of the business situation and can reflect  intangible areas such as the culture of the organisation. Many problems in the current  business system may have originated with the people performing the tasks rather than  being caused by poor process design or inadequate IT systems. There could be differing  viewpoints, misunderstandings, stress from too many tasks, personal differences with  co-workers, dissatisfaction with management or frustration at inadequate resources.",1642,186,410.5
127," Any of these factors could impair the performance of a task, but the traditional analysis  models would not be able to record them. A rich picture allows the analyst to document  all of the human and cultural aspects as well as information flows and information  usage. The unstructured nature of the technique allows the analyst to ‘brain dump’  the information in a simple, pictorial representation. Its strength is that the process of  building the rich picture helps the analyst to form a mental map of the situation and see  connections between different issues. The rich picture can also be enriched further as  more information about the situation comes to light.",671,110,167.75

The  business system or problem under consideration is drawn at the centre of the diagram  with the main elements shown as first level of branches radiating from the central  point. Each of these branches is labelled to indicate the nature of the particular area or  issue; the labels should use as few words as possible, ideally one word.

These models are easy to draw and business stakeholders  find them accessible, so they provide a good communication tool between the analyst  and the business staff. Business process models are also invaluable as a diagnostic aid  since they help identify problems such as delays, bottlenecks and duplicate tasks. They  are described in greater detail in Chapter 7.

Knowing who the stakeholders are, and understanding what it is they  expect from the project and delivered solution, is vital if they are to remain involved and  supportive of the undertaking. One of the major reasons why business analysis projects  do not succeed – or do not succeed fully – is poor stakeholder management. The project  team does not recognise the importance, or even the existence, of a key stakeholder  and they find that their plans are constantly frustrated. On the other hand, if the right  stakeholders are identified and managed properly, most obstacles can be cleared  from the path.",778,122,194.5

Suppliers These provide us with the goods and services that we use. Again, we may wish to  subdivide them, perhaps into: yy major or minor; yy regular or occasional; yy domestic or overseas. Suppliers are stakeholders because they are interested in the way we do business with  them, what we wish to buy, how we want to pay and so on.",641,105,160.25
135,"Many change initiatives have  the effect of altering the relationships of organisations with their suppliers and, as with  the customers, such changes need to be managed carefully to make sure that they  achieve positive and mutually beneficial results. Competitors Competitors vie with us for the business of our customers and they therefore have a  keen interest in changes made by our organisation. We have to consider what their  reactions might be and whether they might try, for instance, to block our initiative or to  produce some sort of counterproposal. Regulators Many organisations are now subject to regulation or inspection – either by statutory  bodies like Ofcom (Office for Communications) and Ofsted (Office for Standards in  Education), or by professional bodies like the General Medical Council. These regulators  will be concerned that changes proposed by an organisation are within the letter and  spirit of the rules they enforce.",953,147,238.25

Or, it could be a limited  company, in which case the owners are the shareholders. For public limited companies,  the majority of shares are held by institutions like investment companies and pension  funds and so the managers of these share portfolios become proxy owners. Employees The people who work in an organisation clearly have an interest in the way it is run  and in changes that it makes.",560,97,140.0

Managers Finally, we have the professional managers of the organisation, those to whom its  direction is entrusted. In a large organisation, there may be many layers of management  and each may form a distinctive stakeholder grouping, for example: yy board-level senior managers; yy middle managers; yy junior managers; yy front-line supervisors. As with many aspects of stakeholder management, it is an error to assume that a group  like ‘managers’ is homogeneous in its views and concerns; junior managers may well  have a very different perspective, and a different set of values and priorities, from those  on the board who take the major strategic decisions.",801,121,200.25
136,"Other stakeholders Of course, the groups shown in Figure 6.2 are generic and, in particular cases, there  may well be other stakeholders. For example, the insurers of an organisation may be  interested in any areas that could affect the pattern of risk that is covered. Or perhaps  the police might be interested in the law and order implications of some actions. In some  organisations, the views of staff associations are also significant. It is important for each project that the identification of stakeholders is as complete  as possible, as it will otherwise be impossible to develop and implement effective  management strategies for them.",646,103,161.5
136,"It may be useful to conduct some sort of workshop  with people knowledgeable about the organisation and the proposed project to make  sure that the coverage of stakeholders is comprehensive. ANALYSING STAKEHOLDERS Having identified the stakeholders, the next step is to make an assessment of the weight  that should be attached to their issues. No stakeholder should be ignored completely  but the approach to each will be different depending on (a) their level of interest in the  project and (b) the amount of power or influence they wield to further or obstruct it. One technique for analysing stakeholders is the power/interest grid illustrated in  Figure 6.3. 106",668,107,167.0
137,"STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT Figure 6.3  Stakeholder power/interest analysis Figu re  6.3 In using the power/interest grid, it is important to plot stakeholders where they actually  are, not where they should be or perhaps where we would like them to be. We can then  explore strategies for managing them in their positions or, perhaps, for moving them to  other positions that might be more advantageous for the success of our project. STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES There is, of course, an infinite number of positions that could be taken on the power/ interest grid but it is probably sufficient here to consider the nine basic situations  illustrated in Figure 6.4. No or low interest and no or low power/influence These are stakeholders who have neither a direct interest in the project nor any real  power to affect it. For practical purposes, they can be ignored as regards day-to-day  issues on a project and there needs to be no special effort made to ‘sell’ them its  benefits.",997,164,249.25
137,"However, as stakeholders do change positions on the map (discussed below), it  is probably wise to inform them occasionally about what is going on – perhaps through  vehicles like organisation newsletters. 107",209,32,52.25
138,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Figure 6.4  Basic stakeholder management strategies Figu re  6.4 Some or high interest but no or low power/influence These groups can be very difficult to manage effectively as, although they may be  directly affected by a change project, they feel powerless to shape its direction in any  way. This can result in frustration and a passive resistance to change that, though  overcome by positional power, can lead to delay and less-than-optimal results. The basic management strategy here is to keep such stakeholders informed of what  is going on and, in particular, of the reasons for the proposed change. But this is a  rather passive approach and, in most circumstances, more effort has to be devoted  to ‘selling’ the project. This can best be done by being as honest as possible about the  need for change; by highlighting the positive aspects of the change or the negative  consequences of not making it; and by frequent and focused communication of  progress.",985,161,246.25
138,"No or low to high interest but some power/influence This is a rather varied group. It includes some stakeholders like middle or senior  managers who do have some power or influence but who, because their interests are  not directly affected, are not very concerned about the direction a project is taking.  108",310,52,77.5
139,"STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT Regulators may also fall into this category and they will only start to get involved if  some breach of the rules is suspected when they could, in effect, squash an initiative.  The group can also include people with more interest in the project but, again, only some  power or influence over it. The best approach with this group is to keep them supportive of the project, possibly by  frequent, positive communication with them but perhaps also by involving them more  with the project. As the old saying has it, it is better to have them inside the glasshouse  throwing stones out than outside throwing them in. No or low interest but high power/influence These are probably very senior managers who, for one reason or another, have no direct  interest in the project.",807,136,201.75
139,"This may be because it is too small or unimportant for them to  bother with or it may be that it is in an area that doesn’t interest them; the Group Marketing  Director, for instance, probably will not be concerned about a project to streamline the  stationery purchasing procedures. For many purposes, it might be thought that they can  be ignored but this is actually a rather risky approach. Our Marketing Director may, for  instance, suddenly get very interested in the stationery system if she keeps getting pens  that don’t work or can’t get hold of any sticky notes for a conference! So, if a situation  arises that might cause them to take a greater interest in the project, we might want to  address their needs directly, via one-to-one meetings perhaps, in order to ensure that they  do not start to raise concerns or even decide to exert their influence. In some situations it is  possible that we may wish to encourage the increased interest of influential stakeholders,  for example, if we felt that their support would help achieve the project objectives.",1069,182,267.25
139,"Where  this is the case, we may need to highlight any aspects of the project that will have a direct  impact upon the stakeholder’s business area; some form of discussion will be required  which, with very influential stakeholders, would typically involve a meeting. Some interest and high power/influence These people have some interest in the project – probably an indirect one as it is  happening within or affecting their empire – and they have real power. The usual  stakeholder management strategy here is to keep them satisfied and, perhaps, to  prevent them from taking a more direct (and hence, possibly, more obstructive) interest  in the project. In other circumstances, the strategy may be precisely the opposite – to get  the stakeholder more actively involved in a project. For example, if the finance director  of an organisation can be persuaded to get positively involved in a project, they will often  be a powerful force for success, since they can make resources available that would  otherwise be hard to come by.",1034,169,258.5
139,"High interest and high power/influence These are the key players, the people who are both interested in the project and have  the power to make it work or not. Often, the key players are the managers of the  functions involved in a project. Initially, it is important to determine if individual key  stakeholders are positive or negative in their approach to a project. If positive, then their  enthusiasm must be sustained, especially during times of difficulty. It is also important  to appreciate the concerns and opinions of key stakeholders and you will need to take  these into account when making any recommendations.",624,102,156.0

It is also vital that the key stakeholders understand the progress of  the project and why certain decisions have been made. These are the people to whom  any final recommendations will be presented and who will have the final say on any  decisions. They need to be kept informed at all stages of the project so that none of the  recommendations come as a shock to them. Those key players who are negatively inclined towards a project can be managed in  various ways, depending on the circumstances: yy By far the best approach is to find some personal benefits for them in the  proposed course of action.",821,145,205.25

This may mean engaging the interest of someone in one of  the high power areas of the grid. Individuals and groups of stakeholders An individual customer may not be of much concern to an organisation such as a big  supermarket chain. But if they post a negative review using social media, write to  newspapers, organise petitions or complain to consumer groups, they can increase their  level of power considerably.",605,95,151.25
140,"A lot of ‘people power’ can damage even large concerns  considerably and force them into major reversals of course. The classic example of  this is the mighty Coca-Cola being forced to reintroduce its traditional Coke in the face  of a massive worldwide customer revolt against a new formula. Similarly, individual  employees can be marginalised by an organisation but, if they are members of a trade  union, their power is greater. A single government employee who objects to a policy may  be relatively powerless but if they ‘blow the whistle’ to national newspapers, they can  cause considerable difficulty. These examples illustrate the dangers of ignoring the weakness of an individual  or mistaking individual weakness for collective weakness.",749,116,187.25
140,"Stakeholders must be  considered not just as individuals but as potential groups as well. Their ability to gain  strength, particularly with the availability of social media mechanisms, should never be  underestimated. SUMMARY OF STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES The basic strategies for stakeholder management are summarised in Figure 6.4 but  individual stakeholders will not fit neatly into one of the nine types and management  approaches must be tailored for each. Also, as we shall discuss in the next section,  stakeholders do not stay in the same place over time and so the ways they are managed  must be adapted accordingly. 110",638,99,159.5
141,"STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT MANAGING STAKEHOLDERS Stakeholders’ positions on the framework in Figure 6.4 do not remain static during the  life of a project. At the most obvious level, a manager may get promoted so that, from  being in the high interest/low power situation, is now both interested and powerful.  Alternatively, the manager may lose interest in a project if promoted into a job with a  wider remit. The circumstances of an organisation may change so that senior managers  begin to focus more on IT projects. A scandal within a competitor organisation may  cause a regulator to take a closer interest in all companies in a sector.",652,107,163.0
141,"This means  that stakeholder analysis must be a continuing activity throughout the project – and  even afterwards to find out what the stakeholders thought of the final outcome. The  project team and project manager should be constantly on the lookout for changes  in stakeholders’ positions and should be re-evaluating their management strategies  accordingly. Once stakeholders’ initial positions have been plotted, a plan should be  drawn up for managing each of them and how to approach it. A one-page assessment  can be made for each stakeholder but a more useful approach would be to see all  stakeholders at a glance by setting up a spreadsheet using the following headings: Name of stakeholder It may also be useful to record their current job titles. Current power/influence From the grid.",798,127,199.5
141,"Current interest From the grid. Issues and interests This is a brief summary of what interests each stakeholder and what we believe their  main issues with the project are likely to be. Current attitude Here, we need to devise a classification scheme, perhaps using the following de­ scriptions: yy Champion: will actively work for the success of the project. yy Supporter: in favour of the project but probably will not be very active in  promoting it. yy Neutral: has expressed no opinion either in favour or against the project.",531,89,132.75
141,"yy Critic: not in favour of the project but probably not actively opposed to it. yy Opponent: will work actively to disrupt, impede or derail the project. yy Blocker: someone who will just obstruct progress, possibly for reasons outside  of the project itself. 111",264,44,66.0
142,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Desired support What we would ideally like from this stakeholder, perhaps using a simple scale of high,  medium or low. Desired role We may wish to get this stakeholder actively involved in the project, perhaps as the  project sponsor or as part of a steering committee. Desired actions What we would like the stakeholder to do, if at all possible, to advance the project. Messages to convey This is where we define the emphasis that should be put on any communications to  this stakeholder. For example, we might need to identify and highlight any issues that  are of particular interest to this stakeholder.",627,105,156.75
142,"The messages are likely to be tailored to  each stakeholder and so the more we know about them and their concerns, the more  effective our communications will be. Actions and communications This is the most important part of the plan, where we define exactly what actions we  will take with regard to this stakeholder. It may be just to keep them informed, in a  positive way, about the project and progress to date. Alternatively, it may be a more  active approach, for example meeting them to engage their interest in the project.  Where a strategy has been devised to change a stakeholder’s position – perhaps to  encourage someone to take a closer interest – then its success must also be evaluated  and other approaches developed if the desired results are not being achieved.",781,133,195.25
142,"As  mentioned earlier, the high interest/high power stakeholders are the key players and  require positive management, such as frequent meetings and discussions about the  direction the project is taking. This will help make sure that they are kept informed about  a project and are happy with the approach that we are taking. Perhaps just as important,  we will understand when their opinions or issues have changed and will reflect this in  the project direction and work as appropriate. DEFINING STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT – RACI AND RASCI CHARTS Apart from deciding on the management strategy for the various stakeholders, it can  also be very useful in a business analysis project to consider the tasks or deliverables  and the extent to which the stakeholders are involved with them. A simple and effective  method for achieving this is to create a RACI chart as illustrated in Figure 6.5.",892,144,223.0
142,"A RACI chart – more formally known as a ‘linear responsibility matrix’ – lists the main  products/deliverables down the side and the various stakeholders along the top.

The project sponsor, for instance, must ultimately be  accountable for the business case for a project. yy Consulted: This person or role provides information that is input to the product  or task.",584,95,146.0
143,"In Figure 6.5, the senior user, other business actors and the domain  expert are shown as being consulted during the interviews and workshops. yy Informed: These stakeholders are informed about a product or task, though they  may not have contributed directly to them. For example, the project sponsor has  the right to be kept informed about any of the products being produced during  the project. A RASCI chart, shown in Figure 6.6, uses a similar approach but has an additional  category S for ‘support’. This person (or role) will provide assistance, and sometimes  resources, to whoever is responsible for the product/deliverable.",635,101,158.75
143,"For example, in Figure  6.6, the business analyst is shown as supporting the project manager in the creation of  the project initiation document and the database administrator supports the business  analyst in developing the class diagram. Yet another scheme that could be used on a linear responsibility matrix includes I  (initiation), E (execution), A (approval), C (consultation) and S (supervision). 113",408,61,102.0
144,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Figure 6.6  RASCI chart Figure 6.6 USING SOCIAL MEDIA IN STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT Once upon a time, in stakeholder management, there really was no alternative to coming  into an organisation ‘cold’ with little understanding of who was who and where they  fitted in. However, the availability of social media offers the business analyst additional  resources to learn about stakeholders and to manage the relationships with them. One obvious way of using social media is to use sites such as LinkedIn to carry out  research about stakeholders. What is their role? What have they done previously in their  careers?",628,99,157.0
144,"Do we have any contacts in common who could introduce us? Once the business analysis project is underway, other forms of social media might  be considered for communicating with stakeholders. For example, when considering  the ‘low/low’ category in Figure 6.4 we said that these stakeholders could effectively  be ignored as they have no direct interest in or influence over the project. However,  resources such as Facebook and Twitter offer a cost-effective way of communicating  with large groups of people on a frequent basis and keeping them informed. This  can help to build a sense of community and make people feel involved in what is  going on.",653,106,163.25

145,"STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT UNDERSTANDING STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVES Introduction It is all very well knowing who the stakeholders are and what is likely to be their  influence on a business analysis project. It is also important to understand their  attitude – how supportive are they of what we are trying to achieve? But it is also vital to  understand what they think, in other words what are their business perspectives? For  example, in a commercial organisation, one stakeholder might feel that any activities  are allowable as long as they are not actually illegal, whereas other stakeholders  may feel that the organisation has some responsibility towards society at large and  therefore conclude that some activities should be avoided on ethical grounds. To help us understand these stakeholder perspectives, and to model the different  business systems that would fulfil them.",893,137,223.25
145,"we can utilise some of the elements from  Peter Checkland’s Soft Systems Methodology (SSM; Checkland 1999).

The basic premise underlying SSM is that  real-world situations are rarely simple and are often very complex.

146,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS When investigating business situations, it is often the case that stakeholders have  different views about what the ‘problem’ is and also about what needs to be done. As  Figure 6.7 shows, there are five main stages that should be applied: 1. 	 The situation is identified, for example the loss of market share by a company  or the poor public perception of a public body, and the issues and causes are  investigated. 2. 	 Stakeholders’ views – perspectives – are sought about what the organisation  is about, what it should be doing and so forth.",565,95,141.25
146,"3. 	 From each stakeholder’s perspective, a conceptual model is created to show  what the organisation should do to fulfil the perspective. 4. 	 These conceptual models are compared with the real-world situation and a  consensus model is generated, possibly by combining elements from various  stakeholder’s perspectives. 5.",324,46,81.0
146,"	 Actions are defined to address the situation by implementing the consensus  model in place of whatever is happening currently in the organisation. Analysing the perspectives – CATWOE SSM provides us with a very useful tool that we can use to explore the stakeholders’  perspectives. Although the technique is known as CATWOE, experience shows that  exploring the CATWOE elements is actually best done in the following order: yy W = Weltanschauung or worldview This summarises a stakeholder’s beliefs  about the organisation or business system, which explain why it exists and  what it should be doing. If we consider the soft drinks merchant business  that was discussed in Chapter 5, the newly appointed Sales Manager believes  that success in the soft drinks trade results from proactively contacting  potential customers and convincing them to buy. However, the Customer  Services Manager believes that success results from establishing close  links with regular customers and providing them with excellent service.",1020,154,255.0
146,"yy T = Transformation This is the principal business activity of the business  system, in other words what lies at the heart of its operations. ( Checkland used  the term ‘transformation’ here because, at the highest level of abstraction,  all systems exist to transform some form of input into some form of output.)  In the case of the drinks supplier, the Sales Manager’s worldview leads to  a transformation that consists of making one-off ‘point sales’, whereas the  Customer Services Manager thinks that it is about providing a high quality  of service throughout the sales process, in order to establish relationships  with customers. yy C = Customer(s) Stakeholders can differ, too, in their views of who their  customers are (or should be). In our example, one view might be ‘anyone  willing to buy from us’ whereas another might be ‘established regular  customers who appreciate a personal touch’.",906,146,226.5

Who, for example, could decide between the two  competing worldviews about the drinks supplier? In this case, the owner is the  business’s chief executive but, in other situations, it could be a group, like a  board of directors. yy E = Environment Finally, all organisations operate within the constraints  imposed by their environment.",812,123,203.0
147,"PESTLE – explored in Chapter 3 – can be  used to identify the main external factors but, in some situations, things like  organisational policies can also feature here.

148,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS In Figure 6.8, the owner and environment for both perspectives is the same. This can  be the case when using CATWOE, although sometimes different perspectives may yield  differences in these areas. For example, we might consider a further environment  constraint to be the willingness of people to buy soft drinks on receipt of an unsolicited  telephone call. Illustrating the perspectives – business activity models Business activity models (BAM) provide a conceptual model of what we would expect  to see to fulfil a particular stakeholder perspective. A BAM shows what the organisation  should be doing, as opposed to a business process model (discussed in Chapter 7)  which explores how it does these things.",730,114,182.5
148,"Creating a BAM requires the business analyst to think about the activities that each  stakeholder’s perspective implies. Initially, there will be one BAM for each distinct  perspective. At a later point, these are examined in order to identify where there is  agreement or conflict between the BAMs. Ultimately, the aim is to combine them  and, in discussion with the stakeholders, achieve a consensus BAM. The approach for creating a BAM is as follows and a completed BAM for Rake’s  Refreshments (drawn from the perspective of the Sales Manager) is shown in Figure 6.9: 1.",574,94,143.5

In Figure 6.9, for example, there are activities to recruit and train salespeople  and to advertise the company’s products. 3. 	 All of the activities of the organisation should follow from PLANNING  activities. Normally, on a BAM, we would not show the strategic planning  activities – setting the general direction of the organisation for instance –  as we are interested in the planning required within this business system  (which will support the strategy execution).",589,93,147.25

On a BAM, we could associate a control activity with each monitoring activity  and some users of the technique prefer to shown them this way. However,  in the real world, managers often take action as a result of a range of  measurements so a less cluttered model can be created by feeding all of the  monitoring activities into one control activity, as in Figure 6.9. 2. 	 The control actions themselves could feed back into any of the other activities  on the model.",651,108,162.75
149,"Since trying to show this would create an impossible-to- understand diagram, the convention is to show a ‘lightning strike’ symbol  emanating from the control activity which means that it feeds back into the  model wherever it is relevant. 119",243,39,60.75
150,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS The model shown in Figure 6.9 represents Rake’s Refreshments as seen from the  perspective of Jason Shore, Sales Manager. As we have seen, though, the Customer  Services Manager, Karen Thorne, sees the organisation rather differently. Both managers  agree that ‘Sell soft drinks’ is at the heart of the business but, for Jason Shore, this means  proactively contacting new customers and pushing them to buy Rake’s Refreshments;  Karen envisages selling to existing customers who contact Rake’s to ask for advice and  guidance on what to buy. If the model had been built from Karen’s perspective, it would  probably not contain the enabling activity E6 ‘Prospect for customers’ but it would have  included activities to recruit and train customer service staff, possibly as brand advisors.  There would also have been an activity to monitor the level of customer satisfaction.",893,139,223.25
150,"Having modelled the organisation from the perspective of each stakeholder (or, at any rate,  of each stakeholder with a different CATWOE), it is now necessary to achieve a consensus  BAM that represents the agreed or idealised way forward. Ideally, this is achieved  through negotiations involving the stakeholders and the business analysts; the aim is  for the stakeholders to all ‘buy in’ to the final BAM. Realistically, however, sometimes the  stakeholders just cannot agree and this is where identifying the ‘owner’ of the business  system (as in CATWOE) is important. The owner has to choose between the competing  BAMs or perhaps impose one that is a composite of several. This is less desirable than  securing all the stakeholders’ agreement, as some people may not necessarily accept the  agreed BAM but it may be the best that can be achieved in some situations.",872,141,218.0
150,"The consensus BAM is an extremely valuable product for a business analyst as it provides  a model of what the business system should look like and should be doing. Insofar as the  actual situation on the ground differs from this conceptual view, this provides a means  of considering opportunities for improvement. Examination of the difference between  the current situation (perhaps reflected in a range of documents including meeting  reports, a rich picture or fishbone diagram – see Chapter 5) and the conceptual view  provided by the BAM, is an important part of gap analysis and is discussed in Chapter 8.  As part of the gap analysis, the business analyst may wish to explore how the activities  are currently carried out, and how they should be performed in the future; this can be  achieved through business process modelling covered in Chapter 7. A note on notation for business activity models There is no universally agreed notation for BAMs.",955,157,238.75
150,"Many users of the technique like to  use ‘cloud’ or ‘thought’ symbols to emphasise that this is a conceptual model and not a  representation of what the organisation looks like now. In Figure 6.9, we have used ovals  for the practical reason that they take less space than clouds and are easier to draw free  hand. It is probably not a good idea to use boxes, as then the models may be confused  with business process models which, as we have shown, illustrate how an organisation  works rather than what it does. Activity ‘threads’ in business activity models Sometimes, rather than considering individual business activities, it is more useful to  group them into ‘threads’ of related activities. For example, in Figure 6.10, we have  extracted from Figure 6.9 those activities related to the recruitment, training and  management of salespeople. (",850,140,212.5

153,7 MODELLING BUSINESS PROCESSES Keith Hindle  INTRODUCTION The business processes are the means by which an organisation carries out the internal  operations and delivers its products and services to its customers. In this chapter we will  look at techniques for modelling business processes covering both the organisational  view of process modelling and the more detailed business process models. There are many reasons for creating business process models: yy To understand how the existing process works. This can be particularly useful  if the process has ‘grown’ organically (without any real planning) and no one is  quite sure what happens currently in response to an event. yy To explain to those working on the process what they do and how their task  relates to the others working on the process.,806,128,201.5
153,"Here, the process model can  be a training aid for new staff and an aide-memoire or reminder for more  experienced personnel. yy To help ensure consistency of approach, so that everyone follows the same  process and customers’ experiences are not wholly dependent on who is  dealing with them, in other words the ‘luck of the draw’. yy To identify the problems and weaknesses of an existing business process with  a view to developing and implementing an improved one. A model of an existing  business process is often called an ‘as is’ model and the improved one is known  as a ‘to be’ model. ORGANISATIONAL CONTEXT A typical organisation has many processes, many of which could be improved in some  way or other.",714,122,178.5
153,"The costs and benefits of such improvement projects will vary enormously  and, before embarking on a business process improvement project, it is useful to  examine the organisational context in which the business processes take place. An  understanding of the context will also help to understand how the process is affected  by external environmental factors. The traditional view of a business is based on the specialist functional areas such  as sales, accounts and operations (Figure 7.1). Typically, this is documented on an  organisation chart which shows the departments and how they are further subdivided,  123",619,94,154.75
154,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS the reporting lines and the staff that work in the various areas. Individual employees  tend to identify with a particular function – ‘I work in IT’ – because that defines not just  the job that they do but also their social group, attitudes and culture. Figure 7.1  Functional view of an organisation Figure 7 .1 The functional view of an organisation is very useful for the internal management and  staff to see how the organisation is structured and where they fit within it. However, there  are some limitations with this view. It is predominantly internally oriented, concentrating  on the structure of the organisation and the internal reporting lines, aspects that are  usually of little interest to the organisation’s customers.",754,121,188.5
154,"Moreover, it defines the formal  structure, ignoring the unofficial communication and cooperation between staff that  can be just as important for success. The functional view is also ‘static’ as it does not  show what the business does over time in order to react to an event such as a customer  requesting a service. The static nature of the functional view contrasts sharply with the process view. The  people carrying out the tasks within a process could well belong to several different  functions and may need to pass information or products across functional boundaries.  For example: yy a customer may first tell a salesperson the details of an order;  yy the order is then passed onto warehouse staff to physically make up the order;  yy next, it is collected by logistics staff;  yy the goods are then delivered to the customer.",838,140,209.5
154," The process view emphasises the need for cooperation between all the participants  if the desired level of customer service is to be achieved. Thinking of the organisation  as separate, autonomous departments may erect barriers and create operational  difficulties that a more joined-up approach can overcome. 124",314,46,78.5
155,"MODELLING BUSINESS PROCESSES AN ALTERNATIVE VIEW OF AN ORGANISATION  Paul Harmon (2007) developed the organisation model that provides an alternative view  of an organisation, providing a representation of both the internal processes and the  external world with which the organisation operates (Figure 7.2). The model is often  developed in two stages: firstly, the external factors that influence the organisation are  considered and then the internal business process is analysed. Figure 7.2  Organisation model (after Harmon, 2007) Figure 7.2 The four areas shown outside the organisation in Figure 7.2 highlight those aspects of  the external environment that need to be considered; they define the context in which  the organisation operates. These four areas are: yy The suppliers of the resources required by the business processes. This covers  not only the supply of physical materials but also external suppliers of finance,  people and ideas.",954,142,238.5
155," yy The beneficiaries from the organisation. While we always include the customers  who purchase the products and services within this group, it is also important  to take a broader view and include other types of customer. For example, the  owners and senior executives of the organisation, or partner organisations that  provide a sales channel to the customers. The owners will vary depending upon  the type of organisation. For example, in a commercial business there may be  shareholders whereas in a not-for-profit organisation there will be a board of  trustees.",569,89,142.25
155,"For each group of beneficiaries, we need to know the outcomes that  they would like the organisation to deliver. These outcomes are often in conflict  with each other; where customers would like prices to be as low as possible,  shareholders would like to have high dividends which they may see resulting  from higher prices.  yy The competitors operating within the same industry or business domain.  Traditionally, this is interpreted to mean other organisations with whom we  are competing in specific markets. In the organisational model, we extend the  concept further by including those organisations that we are competing with  125",638,100,159.5
156,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS 	 for the supply of finance, services, skilled staff and ideas, as well as those who  compete with us for customers.  yy The generic factors that may affect the organisation such as changing regulation,  economics or green issues. These are the type of factors covered by a PESTLE  (political, economic, socio-cultural, technological, legal and environmental)  analysis as explained in Chapter 3. Analysing the external context on the organisation model encourages the business  analyst to think carefully about the context for the organisation. For example: yy What resources does it require to operate?",622,93,155.5
156,Are these plentiful or are they in  short supply? Against whom are we competing for scarce resources? yy Who are the major competitors for the purchasing customers? What do their  processes offer and can we improve on this? yy What are the factors in the external environment that condition or constrain  how we can operate?,324,55,81.0
156,"yy Who are owners of the organisation that we need to satisfy? This is not always  an easy question to answer, for example in the case of a state school: Is it the  governors? The local education authority? Central government? We may need  to consider all of them.",264,48,66.0
156,yy Who exactly are our customers? What do they require from us? How demanding  are they? What are their value expectations? The organisation’s business processes need to operate within this external environment.,211,32,52.75
156," If we are carrying out a business process improvement project, it is important to  understand the business context as this will help us determine the changes that will  deliver business success. THE ORGANISATIONAL VIEW OF BUSINESS PROCESSES Now that we have understood the circumstances in which the business operates, we can  turn our attention to what the business does when reacting to the external environment.  Bearing in mind that the organisation model is a high-level view of the processes that  operate across the entire business, we need to show the end-to-end set of processes  that convert the inputs from the suppliers to the outputs for the customers. It is possible  to identify the high-level processes by discussing with the staff and managers of the  organisation. However, it is helpful to think about an overview framework such as that  shown in Figure 7.3 or Porter’s value chain (Figure 7.6).",915,148,228.75
156,"An organisational business process map is formed from a high-level set of activities  carried out in order to deliver benefit or value to the customers. As shown in Figure 7.3,  the process receives an input and produces an output. When building business process models, we can begin by producing a business process  map that reflects the structure shown in Figure 7.3. Figure 7.4 shows an example of  such a model. 126",419,71,104.75
157,"MODELLING BUSINESS PROCESSES Figure 7.3  A process receiving input and producing output Figure  7.3 It is useful to distinguish between process maps and business process models.  Process maps show sets of related processes, and their interactions, in a single  diagram. Each process set is shown as a box and the arrows between them show their  interdependencies. Business process models show a more detailed view of each of the  processes within a higher level set.  Figure 7.4  Outline process map Figure 7.4 It is useful to begin by considering: yy the core operation at the heart of the entire process, for example, taking  bookings or selling goods; yy the processes that provide input to the core process, for example, scheduling  events or making goods; yy the processes concerned with delivering products or services to the customer,  for example, issuing event confirmation or delivering goods; yy any sales, marketing or customer service processes.",958,151,239.5
157,Figure 7.5  Overview process map for a lending library Figure 7.5 127,69,12,17.25
158,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS The process map in Figure 7.5 shows the processes for the internal lending library of a  consultancy company. The library provides a service to in-house staff (loan item). The loan  process cannot take place unless the person requesting the loan is a registered borrower.  Although we will not have full details about each process at this point we can find out the  events that trigger each process, the customer of that process and the results required.  For example, if we consider ‘Register borrower’: yy The process will take place each week on receipt of information from HR detailing  all the staff changes.",631,104,157.75
158,"This will allow the library to both add and delete borrowers. yy The customers will be the members of staff who are registered and the HR  department who want new employees to be added and employees who have  left to be deleted. yy The results required are the successful addition or removal of employees,  possibly within a prescribed timeframe. Once the loan has been made, the subsequent process would normally be ‘Accept  returned item’ but failure to do this within the specified time period would result in the  process ‘Issue reminder’.  The overview process map is extremely useful when the analyst starts to model a  particular process.",645,107,161.25
158,"It helps to identify the boundaries of each process by showing where  the process begins and where it ends. If we use the example of the lending library,  the ‘Issue reminder’ process concludes with the sending of the reminder, it does not  include the acceptance of the returned item. If we consider the ‘Loan item’ process, the  customer here is the borrower and the process objective is achieved when the borrower  has successfully completed the loan transaction. The measures applied to this process  will be typically concerned with the speed and accuracy of the loan transaction. An alternative approach to building a process map is to look at the products and services  and consider what processes are required to deliver them.",734,121,183.5
158,Michael Porter’s value chain is  a useful technique here because it helps us to structure our thinking and possibly identify  areas of process that we may have missed. The generic value chain is shown in Figure 7.6.  Figure 7.6  Porter’s value chain Figure 7.6 128,264,45,66.0
159,"MODELLING BUSINESS PROCESSES The value chain provides a means of analysing the activities performed by an organisation.  It identifies key areas of primary and support activity that will be required to deliver value  to the organisation’s customers and potentially differentiate the organisation from its  competitors. We can use the concept of a value chain to develop high-level process maps  for the organisation. Figure 7.7 identifies the value chain activities for a manufacturing  organisation using each of the primary activity sections of the value chain. Figure 7.7  Example value chain activities for a manufacturing organisation Figure 7.7 When using the value chain, it is usually easiest to start with the operations – the core  activity of this value chain – and then consider the other areas.",807,125,201.75
159,"In the example above,  we have a manufacturing organisation and the operations primary activity is ‘Make  products’. However, we can only do this if we ‘Obtain raw materials’ so this is the inbound  logistics activity. The outbound logistics activity concerns delivery to the end customers.  In the marketing and sales area, the organisation needs to ‘Promote products’ and ‘Take  orders’. Finally, the service activity involves providing support to customers presumably  by answering queries and dealing with complaints.",521,77,130.25
159,"While the value chain was originally  applied in a manufacturing context, it is possible to apply it to service organisations  although this usually involves combining the operations and outbound logistics areas. VALUE PROPOSITIONS The definition of the value chain assumes that we understand the customers who  purchase our goods and know what products or services they want. A value proposition  is a definition of an organisation’s product or service that will demonstrate to customers  that we understand and can satisfy their needs. Moreover, it differentiates organisations  from their competitors. Unfortunately, many organisations produce poor value  propositions which are bland descriptions of their products rather than being closely  aligned with the needs of their customers.",788,114,197.0
159,129,3,1,0.75
160,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS In order to overcome the problem of inappropriate value propositions, Kaplan and Norton  (1992), the architects of the Balanced Scorecard, have identified the main attributes that  make up successful value propositions. These are the drivers that lead to increased  customer satisfaction, acquisition and retention. The proposition attributes cover three  areas: yy product/service attributes that define the product itself; yy customer relationship aspects; yy image and reputation aspects. The elements of a value proposition are illustrated in Figure 7.8. Figure 7.8  Elements of a value proposition Figur e 7.8 The product attributes are: yy Functionality – or what the product does.",705,102,176.25
160,yy Price – what we charge for the product. yy Quality – or how well the product performs. yy Choice – do we simply provide a standard product or can it be tailored to the  specific needs of the customer? yy Availability or timing – for example how quickly can we respond to customer  requests and do we introduce new products at the most appropriate time? The customer relationship aspects will influence how a customer feels about purchasing  from the organisation.,466,81,116.5
160,"For example, a supermarket chain may want to emphasise  convenient access to their stores as well as knowledgeable staff who have the interests  of the customer as their first consideration. The image may be that of the product, built up through extensive advertising and supported  by the product attributes in order to generate customer loyalty. Thus a bottle of lager may  be described as ‘reassuringly expensive’. Alternatively, a fashion retailer may develop an  attractive image of the typical customer. Effectively, their message to their customers is  ‘buy our clothes and be as attractive and successful as the image in the adverts’.",642,101,160.5
160,"It is useful to understand value propositions because they define what the organisation  believes it needs to deliver to its customers, the business processes being the delivery  mechanisms of the organisations’ value propositions. 130",235,34,58.75
161,"MODELLING BUSINESS PROCESSES An organisation can differentiate itself in three ways: yy by being the most efficient; yy by having the best products; yy by providing the best customer service. Efficiency here means high volumes, low costs (and hence, low prices), for example,  as provided by budget airlines. Having the best products implies high quality but also  innovation and the ability to introduce new products before the competition. Companies  like Apple spring to mind here. High levels of customer service rely on flexibility which  allows the product to be adaptable to the exact needs of the customer as well as staff  that have the attitudes, training and freedom to understand and react to changing  customer needs.",730,116,182.5
161,"The clearest examples are in the expensive end of the leisure industry  which promises to exceed their customer’s needs. When conducting a business process improvement project, an understanding of the  value proposition adopted by the organisation helps the analysts to understand the  focus and objectives of the business processes. For example, where an organisation  prides itself on excellent customer service, the processes delivering the service need  to be designed to ensure that this is what is delivered.  An alternative view of the value proposition is to consider the customer’s perspective.  Customers usually know what they expect and will survey the industry to find  the organisations that will meet their needs.",728,110,182.0
161,"An understanding of the customers’  value expectations helps us to consider whether, and if so how, they align with the  organisational value proposition and can illuminate areas of the business processes  that would benefit from improvement. BUSINESS PROCESS MODELS A business process is triggered by a business event and includes five key components:  the tasks that make up the process, the process flow, the decision points, the actors that  carry out the tasks and the outcome of the business process. Unfortunately, there is no  universally agreed set of terms in business process modelling and the terms ‘process’,  ‘activity’, ‘task’ and ‘step’ are often used interchangeably. For the sake of simplicity, we  have adopted the following convention here: yy ‘Process’ refers to an entire set of activities that start with a triggering event  and end with some output being delivered. yy ‘Task’ refers to an individual activity within the overall process; these are usually  carried out by an actor at a single point in time.",1030,164,257.5
161,yy ‘Step’ refers to the activities carried out within an individual task. It is useful to  show just the tasks on the process model rather than each individual step as  this helps with the readability and clarity of the model. Task descriptions can  then be produced where the steps within each task can be defined. 131,319,56,79.75
162,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Business events There are three types of business event: yy External – these business events originate from outside the organisation or the  business system under consideration. For example, a customer makes a hotel  booking or orders some goods. yy Internal – these business events originate within the business system and  typically involve business managers making decisions. For example, the  marketing manager makes a decision to reduce prices on a product line or the  finance manager decides to review fees charged by suppliers. yy Time-based – these business events occur at a regular point in time.",625,97,156.25
162,"For  example, a process to make salary payments to staff is initiated when it is the  last working day of the month. Developing the business process model Business process models may be developed for many reasons, as we noted in the  Introduction. During a process improvement project, it is common for the business  analyst to produce an ‘as is’ model to show how the process works at the moment.  Analysis of this ‘as is’ model will help to identify problems and weaknesses, leading to  an improved version documented in the ‘to be’ process model. Both types of model are  documented using the same technique.",611,104,152.75
162,"There are many standards for modelling business processes. Two of the most popular  are the UML activity diagram technique and the Business Process Model and Notation  (BPMN). Business process models are often called ‘swimlane diagrams’ because the  ‘swimlanes’ showing all of the tasks performed by a defined ‘actor’, form a key element  of the models. Here, we will use the notation and structure from the UML activity  diagramming technique to build swimlane diagrams.  The swimlane diagramming technique includes the following elements: yy the overall layout;  yy the symbols used; yy the sequencing of the symbols.",619,95,154.75
162,"To build a business process model, we first identify who takes part in the process. This  enables us to identify the business ‘actors’ or ‘roles’. Actors may be individual people,  a group of people or an organisation, or may be an IT system. The tasks carried out by  each actor are shown in a separate band or ‘swimlane’ and arrows are used to show  the flow of the work between the different swimlanes. Swimlanes usually appear on  the diagram in the same sequence as the actors’ involvement in the process, although  it is an informal convention that the customer swimlane is placed at the top.",598,105,149.5
162,"As a result,  the action on the model goes from left to right on a horizontal layout, following the ‘time  axis’ and top to bottom as the different actors get involved. These left to right and top to  bottom flows mirror the way that many people read text, at least in the western world,  132",292,55,73.0
163,"MODELLING BUSINESS PROCESSES and tends to be intuitive. To reinforce this representation of time, it is useful to show a  process flow from Task A to Task B as follows: yy the process flow arrow originating from the right-hand edge of Task A;  yy and ending at the left-hand edge of the Task B symbol. An example of this is shown in Figure 7.9 where there is a process flow from ‘Check  availability of item’ (Task A) to ‘Send item to borrower’ (Task B). The implied left-to-right  flow of time cannot always be shown on the model, however. If, for example, we want  to show a task being carried out iteratively, we will have to include process flows going  right-to-left or backwards; this does not mean they are going back in time but that  the task is being repeated!",770,139,192.5
163,"This example of iteration is one situation where it may be  convenient to show process flows going into and out of the upper and lower edges of  the task symbol. Figure 7.9  Business process model for ‘Loan item’ process Figure  7.9 The diagram in Figure 7.9 shows the expanded process ‘Loan item’. This process  involves two actors, the borrower and the librarian so we have two swimlanes. We  place the borrower (or customer) at the top of the diagram as this is usually where  the process begins or ends. The start and end points of the process are shown clearly  – the former with the named event and the latter with the bullseye symbol.",641,114,160.25
163,"The first  task takes place when the borrower contacts the librarian who checks if an item is  available for loan. Once the librarian has carried out the check the process moves  to the next task, ‘Send item to borrower’. The final task occurs when the borrower  receives the item.  This diagram can be expanded further to show the tasks to deal with a request for  an item that is unavailable. Figure 7.10 shows the decision point, the alternative  flows with corresponding conditions, and the additional task required to handle this  situation.",546,91,136.5
163,133,3,1,0.75
164,BUSINESS ANALYSIS Figure 7.10  Business process ‘Loan item’ with alternative paths Figure  7.10 The alternative paths that could be taken are controlled by a diamond symbol (the  decision point). The conditions under which the process takes each alternate route are  indicated by placing a ‘guard expression’ in square brackets next to the flow lines. For  example [item available] is a guard expression used in Figure 7.10. The action that follows ‘Reserve item’ will be carried out in the ‘Accept returned item’  process from the higher-level model. Within this process there is a check each time a  borrower returns an item.,627,100,156.75
164,The check is made to determine whether or not another borrower  has reserved the item. The librarian will recognise that the item is on the reserved list and  will trigger the ‘Send item to borrower’ task in the ‘Loan item’ process to issue it to the  reserving borrower. This flow is added to the process model as shown in Figure 7.11. Figure 7.11  Business process model with link from another process Figure  7.11 134,420,74,105.0
165,MODELLING BUSINESS PROCESSES It is always good practice to use a limited set of symbols on a business process model.  This will help communication as the model will require minimal explanation when  discussing with business stakeholders. An important convention concerns the naming  of business processes and tasks. The readability of the model is enhanced if each  process and task is named using a standard approach. It is best practice to construct  the process or task name using the verb–noun format and the name should also  describe what the process or task does.,570,92,142.5
165,"Where possible, use specific verbs, avoiding  words such as ‘manage’ or ‘handle’. ‘ Find book’ is a good example; it is specific, clearly  describes what activity is carried out and indicates the situation after the task has been  completed – the book has been found. ‘ Handle payment’ is not specific enough; by the  end of the task, the payment may have been handled but what does that mean?  Business analysts can fall into a common trap when modelling processes – that of  going into too much detail too quickly. The actor who carries out a task often wants  to tell you all about their work at the first opportunity.",621,110,155.25
165,"While this detail is important,  trying to document it very early on can cause problems. The resulting process model  can quickly get out of hand and become difficult for anybody to understand. Initially, it  is more appropriate to show the overall structure of the process and leave the detailed  description till later on. When we first talk to an actor, we are interested in:  yy where they get their input information from; yy in general terms, what they do with it; yy where they forward it after they have completed their work. Once we have documented the overall flow of the process, then we can go back and fill  in the details for each task.",650,115,162.5
165,"This iterative approach means that after we have collected  the details, we may then review the overall flow in light of what we have found out. A major advantage of a business process model is that each actor can easily see their  contribution to the overall process. As discussed earlier, we are trying to provide a  summarised view of the business process at this stage of the analysis. As a result, the  tasks reveal minimum detail. A rule of thumb is to show a separate task for a piece  of work done by an actor at a particular point in time.",548,101,137.0
165,"Each task should be shown as  a single action, receiving an input from the preceding actor and handing over to the  succeeding actor; this flow of work from one actor to another is known as a ‘hand-off’.  It is important to analyse where this occurs as hand-offs often cause problems. This is  discussed later in this chapter.  Analysing tasks The swimlane diagram shows the work carried out within the business process including  actors and the flow of the work. This may be sufficient to identify problems with the ‘as is’  process but often we have to go into more detail in order to really understand how the  process works and what is going wrong.",652,114,163.0
165,A more detailed approach is to analyse each  task (or box) shown on the business process model. We might consider the following  aspects for each task: yy The trigger or business event that initiates the task. yy Inputs to the task. This may include the trigger but there is also likely to be  additional information required to carry out the task. 135,352,62,88.0
166,BUSINESS ANALYSIS yy Outputs from the task. yy Costs relevant to this particular task. yy Measures and standards applicable to the task. yy Detailed breakdown of steps within the task. yy Business rules to be followed in performing the task.,241,40,60.25
166,"Documenting these aspects will help in the analysis of the task and in the identification  of any problem areas or opportunities for improvement. A textual description may  suffice for many tasks but where the steps and business rules are more complex a  diagram, such as a flowchart or UML activity diagram (without swimlanes), will be much  more useful. Hierarchy of process models The set of process models – from organisation-level to swimlane diagram to task  analysis – provides an organised, clear definition of the business processes and  procedures. Figure 7.12 shows this hierarchy.  Figure 7.12  Process model hierarchy Figure 7.",640,100,160.0
166,12 136,6,2,1.5
167,"MODELLING BUSINESS PROCESSES This multileveled approach to business process modelling will necessitate an  iterative approach to the analysis. As the lower level task analyses reveal more  detail, it is inevitable that the higher level business process models will have to be  updated.  Beginning and ending the process The start of a process can be represented in various ways. It is usual for the swimlane of  the process initiator, such as the customer, to be at the top of the model. The variations  between the different approaches determine how much detail is shown in that particular  swimlane.",601,96,150.25
167,"The simplest way, as shown in Figures 7.10 and 7.11, shows the initiator, this time the  borrower, providing the event or trigger that starts off the rest of the processing. The  business that is receiving and processing the request is treating the borrower as an  external stakeholder. It knows nothing about how the borrower creates that initiating  request but simply reacts as soon as it receives the input. In a different situation, the business may work more closely with the initiator. Imagine,  for example, a customer ringing up a call centre to place an order.",570,95,142.5
167,The customer and  the call centre sales person are working together to record the order details. This  could be represented as a single task involving both actors and thus shown on the  boundary between the customer and sales person swimlanes. This situation is shown  in Figure 7.13. Figure 7.13  Task completed by two actors  Figure 7.13 137,343,57,85.75
168,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS A third approach may show the initiator, such as a customer, carrying out the task of  creating the order on their own. In this situation, the entire task of ‘Create order’ is shown  within a customer swimlane. It can be important to know that the customer completes  part of the process without any intervention from the business staff. For example, if  the customer is using the organisation’s website to place the order, the quality of the  website is likely to affect the customer’s perception of the process. Therefore, this task  needs to be considered as an integral part of the process.",612,103,153.0
168,"The end of a process is represented by a bullseye symbol. Usually processes have  multiple pathways and hence multiple ways in which they can end. A retailing  organisation, for example, would normally expect its order process to end with the  successful delivery of the order to the customer. The order could, however, be checked  and rejected. It is important to know the state of the order when the process ends  because that determines what can happen next.",461,77,115.25
168,"If an order has been successfully  delivered to a credit customer, for example, the next thing is to invoice them for the  order amount. For a rejected order on the other hand, the customer must resubmit  it. As a guideline, there should be a separate end for each significant end state. Some  modellers label the end symbol with the name of its state. ANALYSING THE ‘AS IS’ PROCESS Businesses evolve over time.",411,72,102.75
168,"The internal organisation and people within the business  change. The customers and the products we sell them change. As a result, processes  are constantly changing to reflect the different environment in which they operate.  Unfortunately, many of these changes occur in an ad hoc and uncontrolled way. When  we formally model a process, we start to see how messy and incoherent they have  become.",399,64,99.75
168,"Many people are surprised when they first see the swimlane diagram of the  process on which they work. Whilst they are familiar with their own part of the process,  they may have little idea of what the whole process does, how it works and where their  work fits within it.  Identifying problems In order to identify problems with an, as is, process, we need to find out how well it  supports the business. Are the customer-facing processes good enough to satisfy the  customers and ensure that they come back and spend more money? The ordering  process must be fast, accurate and efficient so that it does not cost too much.",625,110,156.25
168,"For analysis  purposes, we need to know exactly what such terms actually mean. How quickly do we  need to deliver the goods to the customer if we are to retain their loyalty? How much  should it cost the business to handle an order? Once we have determined the required  performance levels, the next step is to compare them with the actual performance  of the existing process. Information about the required and actual performance levels  may not be easily available which can suggest several problems.",503,84,125.75
168,"However, it is worth  persevering in order to obtain this information. A gap between the actual and required  performance levels indicates the need for improvements. We can use the ‘as is’ model  as a basis for analysing why the performance targets are not being achieved. There are  two key aspects of the model we need to examine, the hand-offs between the tasks and  the tasks themselves. 138",395,67,98.75
169,"MODELLING BUSINESS PROCESSES Analysing the hand-offs One of the frequent problems found with business processes involve ‘hand-offs’,  where one actor passes the work to another actor. Figure 7.14 shows two hand-offs,  one from the Manager to the Clerk, and the other from the Clerk to the Manager. The  task ‘Calculate results’ has two hand-offs in this diagram, one preceding and one  succeeding. Figure 7.14  Hand-offs on the high-level process model Figure 7 .14 Clear representation of hand-offs is a major advantage of this diagramming technique  and is particularly beneficial when we are trying to improve processes. Hand-offs  account for many of the problems experienced by traditional processes as they can  cause delays, communication errors and bottlenecks to occur.",778,118,194.5
169,"For example, once a piece  of work arrives at its destination it may have to wait in a queue until an actor is free to  deal with it. Too often it is assumed that the work is dealt with immediately when this is  not the case. Analysis of the ‘as is’ processes commonly shows that transactions spend  more than 70 per cent of the elapsed time simply waiting to be processed. It has even  been estimated that, in some processes, the transactions are being actively processed  for less than 10 per cent of the elapsed time, with more than 90 per cent of the time  spent in transit or in queues. Queues form at hand-offs because the two actors have  not synchronised their work.",674,124,168.5
169,"In some situations, attempts to optimise work in one task  can actually make the performance of the whole process worse. For example, working  on batches of transactions may help a particular task to be carried out more efficiently  but the delay caused when waiting for each batch to build up may slow down the overall  progress of the work. A further cause of delays at hand-offs is where there is inadequate resource capacity  to handle the throughput and queues develop. Queues can behave in an odd way,  especially when the transactions arrive in a random fashion. Queuing theory tells us  that attempts to increase the utilisation of the workers under these circumstances will  cause the queues to build up dramatically.",726,120,181.5
169,"The production system on the shop floor of  a factory is a specific example of a process in which the queues, in this case of physical  components that are being produced, are very visible as they are handed over to the  different machine operations, such as milling and turning.  139",284,50,71.0
170,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS There are other problems with hand-offs, often occurring because the transaction  is going from one IT system to another. These systems could be large information  systems or small spreadsheets developed by individuals. Problems occur where the  data issued by the sending system needs to be reformatted to suit the needs of the  receiving software. This not only takes time and effort but can also introduce errors.  Also, subsequent correction of the errors will require additional time and resource.",520,80,130.0
170," Hand-offs cause problems in all organisations. Although a process in a bank, for  example, may seem very different from one in a factory, they both face the same kinds  of problems where hand-offs occur. Hand-offs, and the problems they can cause, are a  major source of inefficiencies in processes, so addressing them can be key to business  process improvement. Analysing the processing The ‘as is’ processes may have been in use for some considerable time and during this  period they may have changed in a piecemeal fashion, reacting to changing business  needs. As a result, they may contain significant inefficiencies and inconsistencies.",645,102,161.25
170,When  analysing business processes it is important to look for the following possibilities: yy Duplication of work. Some tasks may be carried out despite the fact that they  duplicate other actors’ tasks or record the same information. yy Redundancy. Work and/or data that was necessary when the process was first  designed may no longer be required. yy Lack of standardisation.,378,60,94.5
170,"Previously, organisations were less aware of the need  for effective processes and hence there was less emphasis on carrying out  processes in a standard way. Remote locations such as branch offices and  depots were allowed flexibility in the way that they interpreted and implemented  their processes. This may have worked in a decentralised business but now that  there is greater control and centralisation, all the different parts of the business  are expected to operate in an integrated fashion. yy Incompleteness. New requirements may have been identified of the process  since its original design.",605,93,151.25
170,"These may have been ignored because they were too  difficult or costly to incorporate in the existing process or they may have been  handled by a work-around. yy Inconsistent measurement or control. The business process approach has  increased the emphasis on measuring the standard of work and the service  provided to customers. Where a process has developed over time the measures  may not be relevant or may be inconsistent with other measures. If any of these situations are encountered, the analyst needs to apply business process  modelling and improvement approaches in order to rectify the situation.",609,96,152.25
170,"Other factors causing inadequate performance of a process This chapter describes the process modelling technique which helps us to analyse the  design of an ‘as is’ process as a stepping stone to improving its performance. Even  if a process is perfectly designed, however, this does not guarantee that the process  140",319,51,79.75
171,"MODELLING BUSINESS PROCESSES will achieve its performance objectives. There are various reasons why this might be  the case: yy The staff working on the process may not have the right skills, training and  motivation to produce the desired results. yy The resources made available to run the process may be insufficient to handle  the volume of transactions received. This could include both staff and equipment  resources. yy The process may not be managed appropriately.",472,74,118.0
171,"This is a particular problem  when a process crosses many organisational boundaries and there is no single  owner to manage the whole process. IMPROVING BUSINESS PROCESSES Improving the business process is about removing the problems that have been  identified in the ‘as is’ process. Before we accept the initial definition of a problem, it  may be worthwhile stepping back and asking whether this is the real problem that we  should be solving or possibly a symptom of a more fundamental problem. Our initial  analysis, for example, might have identified that our invoice production is taking too long  and we are missing deadlines for billing our customers. One solution to this could be  to allocate more resources to the processing to speed it up.",752,123,188.0
171,"Further analysis, however,  might reveal that the real cause of the delay is excessive rework. A more appropriate  solution to this situation would be to implement tighter controls, reduce the rework and  eliminate the delays without incurring the cost of increased resources. Business rules Business process improvement is also about challenging the assumptions and business  rules upon which the current process is built and which, in some circumstances, may  limit the process. Business rules are categorised in two ways: yy Constraints – these are the business rules that have to be applied and restrict  how a process or task is performed. The constraints may be enforced upon  the organisation, for example they may be legal or regulatory constraints.",757,118,189.25
171," Alternatively, they may result from internal policies or strategies. yy Operational guidance – these are the business rules that determine how  procedures are conducted within the organisation. For example, there may be  rules governing cancellation fees for hotel bookings or postage charges for  delivering orders. Business rules are often simply accepted – ‘It’s the way we do business here’ – but  sometimes it is useful to consider whether there is an alternative approach available.  While some rules may have made sense when they were introduced, it can be useful to  challenge them to see whether they still make sense now.",632,100,158.0
171,"If they do not, then they need  to be changed. A good example is that of a well-known high street store which for many  years sold certain soft drinks by the box – customers had to buy 12 bottles at a time.  When the store reduced the unit of orders down to 6 bottles rather than 12, they found  a significant increase in sales. 141",332,65,83.0
172,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS We describe some commonly used approaches to improving processes below. Simplify the process Simplifying a process can be achieved by eliminating unnecessary tasks or hand-offs.  Certain tasks within a process may have been required when the process was first  introduced but as a result of changes to the business have now become redundant.  For example, reports may still be produced despite the fact that nobody uses them  any longer. Eliminating these tasks not only reduces the running costs and resources  used by the process, it also reduces the hand-offs and their delays.",598,94,149.5
172,"Another example of  simplification is where a number of tasks, carried out by different actors, are combined  into a single task for one actor only. As well as reducing the number of hand-offs, this  can result in other improvements such as a reduction in errors and duplication. There is  also greater scope for giving the actor an extended, more meaningful task to carry out.  The general principle that we are applying here is ensuring that all the processing  adds value. This can involve delivering direct value to the customer or enabling another  part of the process which does itself add customer value.",611,102,152.75
172,"If the task does neither, then  eliminate it. We find non-value adding work when we have to correct errors we have  made earlier in a process. Rigorous checking, appropriate levels of control and ensuring  that errors are corrected as soon as they are discovered will reduce error handling  costs and effort. Extend the processing Where business scenarios have developed that are not covered by the ‘as is’ process,  the likelihood is that workarounds will have been invented. As a result, it is possible  that different actors may handle such scenarios in different ways.",572,93,143.0
172,"The process may be  improved by adding extra tasks to the process, or further steps to a task, in order to  provide a standard way of dealing with these scenarios.  Remove bottlenecks Bottlenecks result when there is a mismatch in the capacities of related tasks. For  example, we have a mismatch if task A can handle 100 transactions per hour and these  are passed onto task B that can only deal with 90 transactions per hour. In this example,  it is easy to see that the bottleneck could be removed by increasing the resources  undertaking task B. However, real life processes are often very complex and require  detailed analysis to identify such capacity mismatches. In these cases, it can be useful to  use sophisticated process modelling tools as they provide simulation facilities that help  us examine the performance and resource requirements of proposed process designs.",880,145,220.0
172," Change the sequence of tasks ‘As is’ business processes often reveal their origins. For example, although a current  process may be supported by an IT system it may not have been subject to considered  process redesign when the system was introduced so is merely an updated version of the  original clerical process. In such a situation, the updated process may have unwittingly  and unnecessarily perpetuated the limitations of the original process. For example, a  process where the tasks are performed in sequence even though this is unnecessary  because there is no logical dependency between the tasks. Modern workflow technology  142",640,100,160.0
173,"MODELLING BUSINESS PROCESSES can free us from this type of limitation. Even if a transaction begins on paper, it can be  scanned and electronic copies sent to several actors simultaneously, so long as they can  work independently. As a result, the elapsed time for the overall process can be reduced  significantly. This is only one example of using technology to carry out tasks in different  ways. Another example is the use of computer systems to automate the flow through a  process, removing the need for human intervention.",529,87,132.25
173,"Redefine process boundary The boundary of an ‘as is’ process may be redefined in order to improve the process. This  may involve extending or reducing the activities carried out by the organisation. This is a  common approach adopted by many organisations where they outsource tasks or even  entire processes to specialist organisations. A variant of this approach is to redefine the  boundary of processes such that external stakeholders, such as customers, undertake  tasks in place of the organisation’s employees. Facilities offered by internet access  can enable such boundary redefinition by enabling customers to have online access to  systems.",651,98,162.75
173,"For example, where order processing staff are replaced with an online booking  system or access is provided to electronic documentation. A similar approach may be  adopted with regard to suppliers. A distribution company supplying goods to retailers  would traditionally require those retailers to submit their replenishment orders as and  when their stocks got low. If the distributor were given access to retailers’ sales data,  they could then maintain the retailers’ stock without any action on the retailers part. Not  only would this make life easier for the retailer but the distributor would have better  information for planning their own stock levels.",661,101,165.25
173,"Automate the processing Automation means using computer software to perform tasks rather than carrying them  out manually. Automation usually leads to faster, cheaper and more reliable processes  and helps with standardising the work practices; this is what many organisations are  seeking when improving their processes. It also results in standardisation of the data  that supports the processes, which is of great benefit to many businesses.  There is a range of automated solutions that are relevant to process improvement  initiatives: yy Bespoke IT development. The definition of the business process provides an  excellent basis on which to define the detailed requirements of a bespoke IT  solution.",707,105,176.75

174,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Redesign the process The approach we have covered so far in this chapter could be described as the  incremental improvement of an existing process. Hence the sequential steps: yy develop the ‘as is’ model; yy analyse the ‘as is’ process and define its problems; yy identify potential improvements; yy document the ‘to be’ process model. There are some situations, however, where we cannot adopt this approach. For example,  there may be no existing process or it may be so radically different from what the  business wants in the future that the ‘as is’ model is next to useless as a starting point.  In this situation, we need to adopt an approach that enables the direct creation of a ‘to  be’ business process model.",737,125,184.25
174,"There may well be a lot of high-level information that defines the environment in which  the new process will operate. The organisation model, the value chain and the value  proposition will reveal the aims of the business and the environment within which the  process needs to be implemented. Additional information may also be available from  strategic plans, business objectives and relevant KPIs. The outline process map will  indicate which other processes the new process is likely to interact with. From these  sources we will be able to model the new ‘to be’ process as a black box, defining: yy the expected outcomes from the process; yy the events or triggers that the process will need to react to.",709,118,177.25
174,"Once we understand the trigger and outcome for a process, we can begin to fill in  the detailed tasks and steps. The best way to do this is to work backwards from the  expected outcomes, determining the logical tasks required to achieve those outcomes.  If we know the planned organisation structure and roles relevant to the new process,  we will also be able to allocate the tasks to the appropriate swimlanes. If there is an existing process, even if it is not relevant to the future business system,  it may be worthwhile analysing it for two reasons. First, we may be able to identify the  underlying business rules that need to be carried through into the new process.",674,118,168.5
174,"They  may not be documented anywhere else. Second, at some time in the future, we will need  to plan how we are going to transfer operations from the old to the new process. To do  this smoothly, we need to know exactly where we are at the beginning of the changeover  and where we want to be at the end. The modelling and analysis of the ‘as is’ process is  essential for this planning activity. PROCESS MEASUREMENT When we are designing an improved business process, we must define not only  what the process does but also how well that processing is to be carried out.",571,105,142.75
174,The  importance of measurement is illustrated by the oft-quoted statement ‘You can only  144,92,14,23.0
175,"MODELLING BUSINESS PROCESSES manage what you can measure.’ If we want the actors carrying out tasks to achieve  the required levels of performance, we need to define the performance measures  and ensure the actors carrying out the work are advised of them. When defining  performance measures, one of the fundamental points to recognise is that there  are two perspectives on performance measurement: measurement for internal  management purposes and measurement by our external customers. Organisations  sometimes create difficulties when they concentrate on their internal measures at the  expense of customer concerns. Internal measures Internal measures are often derived from organisational objectives, critical success  factors and key performance indicators.",765,107,191.25
175,"These measures are usually defined at an  organisational level, cascaded down to departmental level and then further to the  operational level. The operational measures should support the higher-level measures,  right up to the organisational level. The problem with internal measures is that they are  often focused on what the organisation wants to achieve and not on what the customer  values. For example, the organisation may set ‘low cost of operation’ as a critical  success factor for the organisation, defining key performance indicators that specify  which aspects of low cost should be measured. However, when related performance  measures are defined for the business processes, it is possible that the focus on costs  can create problems for the successful delivery of the services to the customer.",811,124,202.75
175,"External measures The other aspect to performance measurement is concerned with what the customer  expects to have delivered. One way of thinking about this is to consider what it is that  each customer group will value about the deliverables it receives from the organisation.  Having identified this, we can then think about the performance measures that we need  to apply internally in order to achieve what our customers require. There are three  major areas to think about: yy the time it takes to complete a process or task; yy the financial measures such as costs or prices; yy the quality measures that are concerned with accuracy and effectiveness. It is important to consider all three areas when improving a business process.",736,121,184.0
175,"If a task is  likely to take too long, there will be consequential effects in other parts of the business  process leading to poor customer service. If an organisation charges for a particular  service but the cost of the process to deliver the service is greater than this charge,  then the organisation is going to run into financial difficulties at some point. If the  performance measures related to quality are not considered, customers may receive  inaccurate information and poor customer service.  Process and task measures One of the key issues for performance measures is to understand customers’ value  expectations. The customer has an expectation of the organisation’s performance in  delivering the product or service.",732,114,183.0
175,"Internally, the process may be made up of several  145",54,10,13.5
176,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS individual tasks, each of which will need to be allocated performance measures. The  task-level performance measures should be aggregated such that the product or  service is delivered within the overall performance measures for the process. Figure  7.15 demonstrates this principle by showing our loan item example with a timeline  added in. This timeline shows that the first task, ‘Check availability of item’, must take  place within two working days of receiving the request from the customer. The second  task, ‘Send item to borrower’, must take place within a further two working days.",610,94,152.5
176,"The  customer must receive the item within a further one working day. Therefore, from item  request to item receipt should take no longer than five days. These are the internal  performance measures but they need to be aligned with the external expectation. If  the external performance measure, the customer view, is that the item will be received  within five working days then the internal measures are fine. However, if the customer  is expecting the item within two working days then these internal measures are likely  to ensure that the customer’s expectations will not be met.",584,95,146.0
176,Figure 7.15  Process model with timeline added Figure  7.15 The performance targets set for a particular process have to align with the expectations  of the customers. If we design a process that results in a service that does not meet  customer expectations then the likelihood of losing customers is very high. Estimating the timeline for a process is difficult. It will depend on a range of factors  including: yy the length of time taken by each task within the process; yy the resources available to support the tasks; yy the number of transactions to be processed and how this varies over time; yy the variety and mix of different transaction types; yy the amount of rework caused by errors; yy the delays and queues at each of the hand-offs; 146,752,130,188.0

Some process modelling software provides performance information by using data on  the above factors to simulate the behaviour of the process. The value of the simulation  results depend on the accuracy of the assumptions and the data fed into the model.  However, the information gained can be very helpful when designing the process and  defining appropriate performance targets.  Cost and time estimates are interrelated so similar issues apply when setting financial  performance measures.",617,92,154.25
177,"The longer the tasks within the process take, the more resource  is required and hence the higher the cost. There may also be trade-offs; in order to  reduce time, we may be able to increase the expenditure on resources. However, it is  important to consider how much the resource will cost and whether or not the reduced  time/higher performance will justify that extra expenditure. Performance issues Measures and targets need to be chosen with care especially when managers are  given incentives to achieve those targets. Targets will change the way that people  behave – that is what they are designed to do.",612,102,153.0
177,"It is possible that the behaviour could  be inappropriate if we have not thought through the implications of the targets. For  example, sales staff are often set sales targets on the assumption that more sales  are good for the business as a whole. However, this may not be true if the increased  sales are achieved by lowering prices too much. This is an example of sub-optimisation  where seemingly better performance in one part of the business can result in poorer  performance for the business as a whole.  BUSINESS PROCESS MODEL AND NOTATION Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) provides a standardised way of drawing  business process models that is comprehensive and unambiguous.",693,112,173.25
177,"It is based on work  that first appeared in 2004 as the Business Process Modelling Language. The Object  Management Group (OMG), who look after UML as well as other software standards,  took over responsibility for BPMN, issuing Version 1.0 in 2006 and Version 2.0 in 2010. There is a lot of interest in BPMN and many software organisations use and support  it. There are two main reasons for this. First, BPMN allows users to represent process  models in an industry-standard way so that they are portable across a range of  modelling tools.",542,92,135.5
177,"Second, users of BPMN can specify very precise process logic that  can be understood and executed by workflow or process engines that control many  business processes. The notation used in BPMN is extensive and very powerful. Process modelling using BPMN is useful in two different, but related, aspects. The  first concerns business analysts when working with the business to understand the  problems with the current processes and consider how they may be improved. However,  once the new processes have been agreed, the second aspect concerns the technical  details of how the processes will be implemented.",610,95,152.5
177,BPMN covers both aspects in a  seamless way and provides an extensive notation set. Some symbols are appropriate  147,117,19,29.25
178,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS for process modelling as carried out by the business analyst, while others have more  relevance for the technical staff.  The basics of BPMN look similar to UML activity diagrams with tasks shown in  swimlanes, and connected by process flows that also link with initiating events and  outcomes. There is a great deal of additional notation that could be used by the business  analyst, including pools, gateways and messages.  A pool consists of lanes, the BPMN name for a swimlane. A process generally shows the  sequence of tasks carried out by different actors, each in its own lane.",603,99,150.75
178,"The customer  that initiates the process can be regarded as an external actor and shown as a ‘black- box pool’, containing one lane only. No activities are shown in this pool (hence the black- box title) as the work of the external actor is invisible to the process being analysed.  A gateway controls the flow through the tasks of a process. In BPMN, a gateway is  represented as a diamond but it is more than a UML decision point. With a letter O  inside the diamond, it can indicate an either/or decision (like the UML decision), whilst a  + indicates a parallel process flow.",579,104,144.75
178,Messages show how processes may communicate  with each other and hence how they collaborate.  BPMN provides an extensive set of symbols and concepts. As business analysts we need  to take care when using BPMN as it is important to recognise that the models we build  are a means of communication with the business; too much technical detail would result  in a model that was difficult for the business staff to understand. Some BPMN specialists  recommend that business analysts only use a subset of the BPMN facilities; Bruce  Silver’s (2009) BPMN Methods and Style provides details of his Level 1 palette of facilities. SIX SIGMA An alternative approach to process improvement is embodied in the Six Sigma  approach developed by Motorola in the 1970s and based on ideas from statistical  process control.,806,131,201.5
178,"First used in manufacturing industries in the reduction of product  defects, it is now used in a range of organisations including those in the pharmaceutical  industry, local authorities, food processing, hospitals, the military, logistics, NASA and  financial services. Its purpose is to eradicate performance deficiencies in processes  that are critical to achieving customer satisfaction. These processes might include  complaint handling, order fulfilment or delivering a package to a customer’s house.

179,yy Measure the data. This means obtaining the data to identify the symptoms;  do they occur all the time or from time to time? Produce a map of the process  that is producing the problem. Concentrate on the symptoms doing the most  damage. yy Analyse the results so far.,270,49,67.5
179,Be creative and prepare theories about the causes  of the problems. Document the theories and test them. Identify the root causes. yy Improve the process. Assess alternative improvement methods.,194,29,48.5
179,Design and  test the chosen method. Implement the chosen method.  yy Control the new process and monitor its effectiveness. Six Sigma can be seen as a very methodical and structured approach to process  improvement that uses data and measurement to identify where the most business  benefit can be obtained. The aim is to reduce errors so that all processes meet or  exceed customers’ expectations and that there are no more than 3.4 defects per million  occurrences.,467,76,116.75
179,"In the Global Deliveries PLC example this would translate into performance  that delivers the right package to the right place at the right time 99.997 per cent of the  time! SUMMARY An organised, structured approach to business process improvement will be beneficial  for both the organisation and the business analysts carrying out the work. We have  described an approach using an organisational view of processes that is then developed  further into more detailed business process models. Business process models can be  used for many purposes, including business improvement and staff training, but if they  are to be useful it is important to produce clear, easily understood diagrams and well- structured supporting documentation.

181,"8 DEFINING THE SOLUTION Debra Paul and Paul Turner INTRODUCTION One of the key activities conducted by business analysts is the analysis of the gap  between where the business is currently and where it needs to be in terms of its  processes and systems. However, analysing the gap requires detailed thought and an  understanding of the implications associated with implementing the proposed changes.  While addressing the problematic areas identified during the analysis process, the  selected option will also need to align with the defined business architecture for the  organisation. This chapter looks at two aspects regarding the development of options for business  change: 1. 	 Analysing the gap between the current and desired business systems.",752,114,188.0
181,"2. 	 Ensuring the alignment of any proposed actions with the business archi- tecture. GAP ANALYSIS In essence, gap analysis requires the business analyst to explore the differences  between a current state and a desired future state. Gap analysis can apply at different  levels, depending upon the situation. A Business Activity Model (BAM) provides a  conceptual overview of a desired future business system, showing ‘what’ activities  would be needed to fulfil a stakeholder perspective, or where this is a consensus BAM,  the agreed perspective.",548,83,137.0
181,"Each of the activities shown on the BAM may be examined in  order to identify where deficiencies lie. At a more specific level, gap analysis may be  used to examine any of the following areas: yy the ‘as is’ and ‘to be’ business process models; yy the competencies held by an individual and those required for a particular role; yy the IT system requirements and the features offered by an off-the-shelf soft- ware package. Identifying areas of concern The activities on the BAM should be inspected and categorised in order to identify those  requiring further attention. Three categories may be used for the activities: 151",624,105,156.0
182,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS yy operating satisfactorily – no immediate action; yy some issues to be addressed – action required; yy not in place – urgent consideration. Categorising the activities in this way allows us to prioritise the work in line with the  original objectives and scope for the business analysis work. Once we have an idea of  the areas requiring most attention, we can conduct the gap analysis at a more detailed  level, focusing on ‘how’ the work is conducted.  Framework for gap analysis In Chapter 5 we discussed the techniques which may be used to investigate and represent  a current business area or situation. As explained in that chapter, it is often the case that  the initial investigation focuses on modelling the processes or defining the requirements  but this can lead to the change proposals being limited or failing to address the real  problems.",873,144,218.25
182,"The holistic approach adopted by business analysts helps to avoid such issues.  When taking a holistic approach, the analysts ensure that they consider aspects such  as the organisation’s structure, culture and management style in addition to examining  the business processes and IT systems. The POPIT model, shown in Figure 8.1, can help  considerably with this investigation as it provides a framework and aide-memoire that  helps ensure that the analysis considers all of the required elements.  Figure 8.1  The POPIT model Figure 8.1 The POPIT model will be used to organise the gap analysis discussion below. Processes The usual starting point for gap analysis is to consider the ‘as is’ and ‘to be’ processes.",716,113,179.0
182," This is a good place to begin because any changes made to processes inevitably require  other POPIT elements to change. This may range from a relatively minor change of a  job description to a significant revision of the entire team structure. For example, if a  152",267,46,66.75
183,"DEFINING THE SOLUTION process improvement requires that two roles are to be merged, then there is likely to be  a corresponding impact on the structure, job role descriptions, skill requirements and IT  systems. The definition of the revised processes will need to be clear and unambiguous  which is why using a standard modelling technique, such as that described in Chapter 7,  can be extremely helpful. It is also important that a more detailed definition is developed,  representing the procedures to be applied when individual tasks are undertaken; this  is necessary to support the definition of the IT requirements, clarify any new process  documentation requirements, support the development of revised job role descriptions  and form the basis for training in the new processes.  Information and technology Business process improvements are often concerned with the retrieval and distribution  of information so gaps associated with this area are often identified. During gap analysis,  the information required should be analysed using techniques such as document  analysis and modelled using entity relationship models or class diagrams.",1148,171,287.0
183,"These help  to identify the information needed to perform the business processes, identify where  additional information is required and clarify the information requirements. The technology element of the POPIT model is often the core enabler of the business  change. Typically, it will be important to think about the following areas: IT support If the ‘to be’ business processes require additional IT support, the analysts will need  to consider the requirements that should be delivered by the technology. This may  mean the functional requirements but may also lead to the definition of non-functional  requirements. These requirement types are discussed further in Chapter 11.",681,102,170.25
183,"Many  organisations are constrained by legacy systems which are not very adaptable to  changing business needs or by poor scalability – the capacity of the systems to handle  higher volumes. These issues need to be considered when introducing new processes  as they can represent a gap that it will be important to address. Accessibility When introducing a change to the IT systems used to perform processes, it is important  to ensure that the systems are as accessible as possible; this means considering the  user population for the systems. If there is poor accessibility, the IT systems may not be  used effectively. If business staff are unable to use, or have difficulty in using, a system  they will avoid doing so, which is likely to lead to them developing unauthorised and  undesirable workarounds in order to conduct their work.",840,138,210.0
183,"Other stakeholders, such as  customers and suppliers, may decide it is easier to work with other, perhaps competing,  organisations. Alignment with the enterprise architecture A major problem in many organisations is that the IT systems are not well-integrated  with each other or with the overall infrastructure that exists for the delivery of the IT  services. This can lead to problems such as limited automatic data transfer, which may  result in the re-keying of data, inconsistent data formats and definitions, and different  systems holding differing values for the same data. During gap analysis, it is critical that  153",629,97,157.25
184,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS such issues are considered. Introducing new IT functionality without considering how  this impacts upon, or needs to align with, the existing IT systems and infrastructure may  end up introducing additional problems rather than solving those that exist currently. Organisation This is often the area that is overlooked during gap analysis and option development.  However, it is extremely important as it can be where gaps exist that have the potential  to undermine the new business system and processes. One of the reasons why a holistic  view is so important during the investigation of the current system, is that it causes us  to consider organisational aspects such as structure and culture.",715,111,178.75
184,"McKinsey’s 7-S model  (Figure 8.2), introduced in Chapter 3, can be useful here, providing a framework for  thinking about the different elements that contribute to the organisational view. Figure 8.2  McKinsey’s 7-S model Figure 8. 2 The 7-S model sets out the aspects of the organisation that need to be considered if a  change is to be introduced successfully. If we map this onto the POPIT model, we can  see that some of the 7-S elements are already covered: yy ‘systems’ is analysed from the three views of process, information and  technology; yy ‘staff’ and ‘skills’ form part of the people view.  So, from the organisation perspective, we need to think about the remaining four  aspects: shared values, style, strategy and structure.",742,122,185.5
184,"The shared values are at the core of the organisation. In undertaking a gap analysis,  we need to ask if these shared values are explicit and communicated, and if they really  help drive the other areas such as the systems and structures. Moving to a new, desired  154",268,48,67.0
185,"DEFINING THE SOLUTION position, may require us to think about the manifestation of any inconsistent views in  the existing business system and the impact of values upon the work practices. We also  need to consider the style adopted by management and the culture that exists within  the area under consideration. Is this in line with the values and the strategy and will it  help in the introduction of the desired changes or will there need to be some work to  align this? More tangibly, the structure of the business area may need to be changed. At  a micro level, some job roles may need to be combined but there may also be impacts  at a broader level whereby whole teams or even departments need to be merged or  reorganised.",730,129,182.5
185,"It is also possible that more fundamental change to the structure may be  needed such as the change from a regional to a product-based structure. It is sometimes said that the key aspects of the McKinsey model are not the individual  elements but the lines that connect them. Whatever the changes, there must be  congruence between the different elements and, where this is not the case, there is  some misalignment in the organisation which should be addressed. For example, there  may be a difference between what managers say they want (strategy) and the behaviour  they expect (style). People It is particularly important that any business change proposals set out the approach to  deployment that will be adopted, including planning for communicating the changes  to any affected staff.",791,127,197.75
185,"The analysis should consider the impact upon the people who  will perform the work and identify any gaps to be addressed. The following areas are  particularly important: Skills We need to think about what skills the new job roles require, how much support will  be needed during the transition and what training should be delivered to ensure the  smooth implementation of the new business processes. The changes may generate  a need for training in the new tasks, the new process flows, the new information or  even the new rules to apply when making decisions. The events that trigger the tasks  may have changed or the information used may originate from different sources. All of  these aspects needs to be considered in order to define the training and support needs.",772,129,193.0
185," For some business changes, the initial communication and support may have been  inadequate so training is required even for tasks that have not changed.  Recruitment If there is a skills gap, there may be a need for further recruitment of staff. The definition  of the required skills will help to provide a basis for any additional recruitment. However,  there may be a more significant gap in that there may not be a properly defined  recruitment policy and inadequate methods may be used for recruitment. If either of  these is the case, problems with the team’s skills may result and the business changes  may be undermined.",629,105,157.25
185,"Therefore, it is important to consider staff recruitment policies  as part of the gap analysis activity; they may cause problems during deployment if we  need to change or extend the skills of the team but, in the longer term, may also serve  to perpetuate recruitment issues. 155",280,47,70.0
186,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Staff development One of the gaps may concern the approach adopted to career development. It is  important to think about questions such as ‘Is there an appraisal scheme in place?’  and if so, ‘Does it appraise the right things and lead to effective skill development?’  Sometimes, it is useful to think about how the current personal development processes  are working as they may be the root cause of some problems. If so, they are likely to  interfere with the successful introduction of changes.",517,85,129.25
186," Motivation and reward It can also be useful to consider the levels of staff motivation and, more tangibly, the  reward systems in place. Again, there may be issues here that can be causing problems  and undermine the performance of the organisation. For example, if there is a problem  with staff motivation, the introduction of a new suite of processes and systems may  worsen this. The alignment of reward systems with the objectives of the organisation is  vital if the change is to succeed. FORMULATING OPTIONS Once we have an understanding of the gaps to be addressed, we can begin to formulate  the options for change.",625,105,156.25
186,"As in all business changes, we need to ensure that any proposals  are feasible from the financial, business and technological perspectives. The approach  to this is considered in Chapter 9. The key is that the options are holistic. It is of no use  putting forward proposals that change one or two elements of the POPIT model while  not considering the others; the best IT systems in the world will not operate effectively  if the people do not know how to use them or cannot access them. Similarly, it is not  possible to change a team structure without considering the impact on individuals and  ensuring that they are clear about the new way of working.",656,114,164.0
186,"DEFINING BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS The outcome from the gap analysis is a list of business requirements that need to be  delivered. These requirements are likely to be at the ‘what’ level rather than dictating the  precise ways in which they will be met. However, at this point, there are likely to be some  requirements that will need to form part of the IT solution. Chapters 10–12 discuss the  definition and management of requirements. INTRODUCTION TO BUSINESS ARCHITECTURE Organisations are becoming increasingly aware of the need to hold a formal definition  of the architecture of their business.",599,95,149.75
186,"Any proposed business change must align with the  business architecture. It is common for even small changes to affect multiple processes,  IT systems and databases requiring vast expense, often without the change adding any  real value and causing disruption to areas of the business that were working well. In  many cases, this is because business analysts usually work in one designated area  and do not always have the opportunity to see how the change they propose fits within  156",486,79,121.5
187,"DEFINING THE SOLUTION the broader picture or indeed whether work being undertaken elsewhere may impact  upon their work. Without a high-level model or blueprint of the overall business, and  its interface with its customers, suppliers and partners, any proposed change will be  difficult to assess in terms of the impact and potential disruption.  A business architecture begins to evolve when two or more business areas (including  those from outside the scope of the specific business itself) are thought of as an  integrated set of capabilities that delivers value. The business architecture helps to  provide increased visibility and effectiveness. Once a high level plan or blueprint of the  organisation exists, it is possible to evaluate various scenarios for change in terms of  their impact and effectiveness, and ensure that any changes to be undertaken can be  aligned with this overall business architecture.",920,141,230.0
187,"Therefore, it can be seen that a business  architecture provides a bridge between the organisation’s defined strategy and the  execution of the strategy. DEFINITION OF BUSINESS ARCHITECTURE The Business Architecture Guild (2014) defines business architecture as:  A blueprint of the enterprise that provides a common understanding of the  organisation that can be used to align strategic objectives and tactical demands. This definition encapsulates the important role that the business architecture plays  as an interface between strategy and the implementation of change. Hence, employed  effectively, a robust business architecture results in the following: yy the strategy drives changes to the business architecture; yy the business architecture informs and refines the strategy; yy the business architecture translates the strategy for execution; yy the strategy execution enables and generates improvement to the overall  business architecture. A business architecture has three primary objectives: 1.",1008,140,252.0
187,"	 To promote organisational health: to ensure the longevity and well-being of  the organisation, generating an ability to be flexible and agile in the delivery  of change. 2. 	 To help fulfil unrealised opportunities: promoting appropriate reaction to  external influences and proposed initiatives, and identifying the areas of the  business which would most benefit from any transformation. 3. 	 To aid organisational performance in a competitive market place:  implementing best practice, encouraging reuse, monitoring business metrics  and focusing on those areas of the business that deliver the most value to  the end customer.",632,90,158.0
187,157,3,1,0.75
188,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS In addition, it is worth keeping in mind the following key points about a business  architecture: yy The scope of a business architecture is the scope of the business. yy A business architecture is not prescriptive. yy A business architecture is developed iteratively. yy A business architecture is reusable across business units and businesses. yy A business architecture is not about the deliverables, it is more concerned with  reflecting the underlying philosophy and values.",497,76,124.25
188,"While a business architecture represents the business, its coverage does not begin or end  at the boundaries of a specific enterprise. It must also be capable of representing aspects  of the business that that are undertaken by external stakeholders such as outsourced  suppliers. This is supported by the use of techniques such as value stream analysis and  is consistent with a focus on what the business does rather than how it does it. STRUCTURE OF A BUSINESS ARCHITECTURE There are many models and documents that could be included as artefacts within a  business architecture; in effect they would provide many different views of the business.  For example, the artefacts of a business architecture might document any of the following: yy capabilities; yy values; yy information; yy products; yy suppliers and partners; yy motivations; yy business units; yy policies.",872,138,218.0
188,"It is important to consider the maintenance overhead that may arise if there are  numerous artefacts, given that they would all need to be defined and maintained.  Also, cross references between artefacts will be required in order to ensure overall  consistency. Any artefacts that are included in an organisation’s business architecture  should always be at a high level of abstraction and subsequently mapped to the detailed  artefacts and models more familiar to business analysts. For example, the business  architecture artefacts would map onto, and align with, the detailed business process  models, but would not contain these processes.  Evolving best practice has shown that the key elements of a business architecture  represent the following areas: 158",763,115,190.75
189,"DEFINING THE SOLUTION yy business motivations; yy business capabilities; yy value streams (which can be mapped to more detailed business processes); yy organisational business units; yy information concepts. From this list, the business capabilities and the value streams that enable them,  are widely regarded as the essence of an effective business architecture; it is with  these artefacts that the construction of a business architecture should always begin.  Business analysts can use the artefacts to ensure that any work they undertake and  changes they propose, are consistent with the business architecture. Also, the business  analysts may add to the business architecture over time in order to extend its coverage.  This would be done within a robust governance regime to ensure continued consistency  and correctness of the business architecture artefacts.",868,128,217.0
189,"BUSINESS ARCHITECTURE TECHNIQUES There is a wide range of techniques that can be employed when defining the business  architecture. These techniques vary from those that focus on the bigger picture of the  business architecture, such as business model definition, business motivation analysis  and capability modelling, through to more detailed techniques such as value stream  analysis, value network analysis and information mapping. The two key techniques from this list that form the essence of an effective Business  Architecture are: yy business capability modelling; yy value stream analysis. Business capability modelling Capability models represent, at a high level, what the organisation needs to be able  to do in order to deliver value to customers. While these initial capabilities can be  decomposed to a number of levels, they should never reflect how delivery is actually  achieved in practice.",910,135,227.5
189,A capability is a particular ability to achieve an outcome and reflects something a  business is able to do that creates value for a customer. A full business capability model  usually investigates and models the whole organisation across a number of business  strata (layers). The main strata found on a typical business capability model would be: yy strategic or direction setting; yy core or customer facing; yy supporting. 159,430,69,107.5
190,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Within each of these strata, Foundation (level 1) capabilities are identified initially and  are then expanded into more detailed capability groups and, ultimately, standalone  reusable capabilities. Table 8.1 provides some examples of business capabilities at the Foundation level. Table 8.1  Examples of foundation level business capabilities Stratum	 Foundation capabilities Strategic	 Business planning 	 Capital management 	 Policy management Customer facing	 Distribution 	 Customer service 	 Product development 	 Account management Support	 Staff recruitment 	 Procurement 	 Vendor management It should be noted that the following rules apply when producing a business capability  model: yy capabilities should be defined in business terms; yy capabilities should be named as nouns not verbs; yy capabilities are static (value streams show movement); yy capabilities should be unique across the entire capability model; yy capabilities are enabled via value streams. Organisations that document and maintain business capabilities can change more  quickly and effectively than those that do not. It is also invaluable when working with  external suppliers or partners if the organisation has a view of the capabilities needed  to deliver the required value to customers.",1295,176,323.75
190,"For example, if considering working with  a partner organisation, the definition of the capabilities required for the services to  be delivered by the partner, will help in the evaluation – and possible removal – of  prospective partners. 160",242,38,60.5
191,"DEFINING THE SOLUTION Value stream analysis There are many techniques that can be used to investigate and represent the delivery  of value. The value stream approach is one of the most powerful when used as part of  a business architecture.  A value stream is an end-to-end collection of high-level linear stages that create an  outcome of value to a specific customer group. This may be either the ultimate customer  or an internal end-user of the value stream. Value streams are used to identify, map  and analyse the value exchanged between an organisation and various stakeholders  (internal and external) that interact with it.",632,102,158.0
191,"They focus on the delivery of value and may  not reflect the way the work is done in practice. The value stream shows the main sequential stages which add value to the customer.  It should be noted that the value stream considers all the stages needed, regardless  of how many organisations or business units may actually be involved in delivering  the value. Figure 8.3 shows an example of a value stream dealing with mortgage  applications on behalf of a mortgage lender. Figure 8.3  Example value stream for mortgage application Figure 8.3 Figure 8.3 shows the value stream for ‘Mortgage application’ decomposed into its key  stages in sequence.",648,107,162.0
191,"The diagram does not show who performs each of the different  stages. It can be extended by mapping the business capabilities onto the stages of the  value stream, showing how each stage is enabled by these capabilities.  It is common for each of the individual stages within a value stream, such as the one  shown here, to be enabled by a number of organisational capabilities identified from  the previously defined Business Capability Model. In most cases these would usually be  either level 2 or level 3 capabilities rather than at a Foundation level. When producing a value stream, it is worth noting some key guiding principles.",635,106,158.75
191,Value  streams should: yy be stakeholder focused; yy take a holistic view; yy be customer centric; yy facilitate further decomposition; yy help identify which business capabilities help achieve stakeholder value. 161,216,31,54.0
192,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Organisations that understand the value streams within which they operate, and who  appreciate their role in delivering value, are well placed to promote the effective delivery  of value to the recipients of their products and services. SUMMARY Gap analysis is concerned with identifying the differences between the current  business situation and the desired future business system. When analysing the  gap, we need to take a holistic view, considering elements such as the business  processes and people in addition to the processes and IT systems. It is important that  any proposed changes are aligned with the business architecture. The overall goal  of a business architecture is to enable an organisation to focus on the products and  services it delivers to its customers and the value these customers receive.",836,129,209.0
192,"Hence,  any business architecture needs to reflect a high level of abstraction, considering  what the business needs to do to deliver value to its customers rather than how, who  or where this value is delivered. Techniques such as business capability modelling  and value stream analysis may be used to represent such an abstraction.

193,"9 MAKING A BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL  CASE James Cadle INTRODUCTION A business case is a key document in a business analysis project and is the place  where the analysts present their findings and propose a course of action for senior  management to consider. This chapter considers the purpose, structure and content  of a business case and provides some guidance on how to assemble the information  and to present the finished product. One thing worth remembering is that, to some  extent, a business case is a ‘sales’ document, aimed at getting people to take a  decision. Therefore, some of the key rules of successful selling apply: stress  benefits, not features; sell the benefits before discussing the cost; get the ‘buyers’ to  understand the size of the problem – or opportunity – before presenting the amount  of time, effort and money that will be needed to implement a solution. THE BUSINESS CASE IN THE PROJECT LIFECYCLE A question often asked about the business case is ‘when should it be produced?’",1011,168,252.75
193," This issue is addressed in Figure 9.1. As the illustration shows, a business case is  a living document and should be revised as the project proceeds and as more is  discovered about the proposed solution and the costs and benefits of introducing  it. In addition, organisations and the environments in which they operate are not  static and so the business case must be kept under review to ensure that changing  circumstances have not invalidated it. The initial business case often results from a  feasibility study, where the broad requirements and options have been considered  and where ‘ballpark’ estimates of costs and benefits are developed. The ballpark  figures must, however, be revisited once more detailed analysis work has been  completed and a fuller picture has emerged of the options available.",813,129,203.25
193,"It should also  be examined again once the solution has been designed and much more reliable  figures are available for the costs of development. The business case should next be  reviewed before the solution is deployed, precisely because the costs of deployment  are now more reliable. Also, business circumstances may have changed and it may  not be worth proceeding to implementation. Finally, once the proposed solution has  been in operation for a while, there should be a benefits review to determine the  degree to which the predicted business benefits have been realised and to identify  actions to support the delivery of these benefits.  163",652,104,163.0
194,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Figure 9.1  The business case in the project lifecycle Figure 9.1 Figure 9.1 refers to each of these review points as ‘decision gates’. The concept shown,  now widely used in project management, is that projects should pass certain tests – not  least those relating to their business viability – before they can be allowed to proceed  to the next stage. IDENTIFYING OPTIONS The first step in putting together a business case is to identify and explore the various  options that exist for solving the business issue. There are actually two kinds of options: yy Business options that explore what the proposed solution is intended to achieve  in business terms – for example, ‘speed up invoice handling by 50 per cent’ or  ‘reduce the number of people we need to staff our supermarket’. yy Technical options that consider how the solution is to be implemented, often  through the use of information technology.",926,153,231.5
194,"At one time, it was considered that these two elements should be considered separately  and deal with business first, the aim being to avoid the technical ‘tail’ wagging the  business ‘dog’. Nowadays, however, most changes to business practice involve the use  of IT in some form and it is often the availability of technology that makes the business  solutions possible. For example, one way of reducing the need for staff in a supermarket  would be to enable customers to scan their purchases themselves using ‘smart’ bar  codes. For this reason, it is a bit difficult to keep business and technical options separate  but it remains true that business needs should drive the options process, rather than  the use of technology for its own sake. 164",750,125,187.5
195,"MAKING A BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CASE The basic process for developing options is shown in Figure 9.2. Identifying options  is probably best achieved through some form of workshop, where brainstorming and  other creative problem-solving approaches can be employed. Modelling techniques  such as Business Activity Modelling (Chapter 6) or Business Process Modelling  (Chapter 7) are also useful to help generate options. The aim is to get all of the possible  ideas out on the table before going on to consider which ones are most promising. Even  if some of the ideas seem a bit far-fetched, they may provide part of the actual solution  or stimulate other people to come up with similar, but more workable, suggestions.",719,115,179.75
195," Another way of identifying options is to study what other organisations – possibly your  competitors – have done to address the same issues. Figure 9.2  Process for developing options Figure 9. 2 Once all the possibilities have been flushed out, they can be subjected to evaluation to see  which ones are worth examining further. Some ideas can usually be rejected quite quickly  as being too expensive, or taking too long to implement, or being counter-cultural. The  criteria for assessing feasibility are examined in more detail in the next part of this chapter.",566,92,141.5
195,"Ideally, the shortlist of options should be reduced to three or four, one of which will  usually be that of maintaining the status quo, the ‘do nothing’ option. The reason for  restricting the list to three or four possibilities is that it is seldom practical, for reasons  of time or cost, to examine more than this in enough detail to be taken forward to  the business case. Each of the short-listed options should address the major business  issues but offer some distinctive balance of the time they will take to implement, the  budget required and the range of features offered. Sometimes, though, the options are  ‘variations on a theme’, with one just dealing with the most pressing business issues  and others offering various additional features. This situation is illustrated in Figure 9.3.",800,132,200.0
195,Figure 9.3  Incremental options Figure 9.3 165,46,7,11.5
196,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS In Figure 9.3, the bottom option just deals with the most pressing issues, as quickly  as possible and at minimal cost. The next option adds some additional features to the  solution but costs more and takes longer. The last option is a comprehensive solution  but obviously takes the longest and costs the most. One option that should always be considered – and which should usually find its way  into the actual business case – is that of doing nothing. Sometimes, it really is a viable  option and might even be the best choice for the organisation.",570,98,142.5
196,"Often, though, there is no  sensible ‘do nothing’ option as some form of business disaster may result from inaction.  In this case, the decision-makers may not be aware that action is imperative and so  spelling out the risks and consequences of doing nothing becomes an important part of  making the case for the other options. ASSESSING PROJECT FEASIBILITY There are many issues to think about in assessing feasibility but all fall under the three  broad headings illustrated in Figure 9.4. Figure 9.4  Aspects of feasibility Figure 9 .4 Business feasibility issues include whether the proposal matches the business  objectives and strategy of the organisation and – if it is a commercial firm – if it can  be achieved in the current market conditions. There is the question of whether the  proposed solution will be delivered in sufficient time to secure the desired business  166",883,144,220.75
197,"MAKING A BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CASE benefits. The proposal must ‘fit’ with the management structure of the organisation  and with its culture, as lack of cultural fit is often a cause of projects not meeting the  expectations held for them. The solution must align with the enterprise architecture  for the organisation. The proposal may be for major process change so may have to  align with other processes, including those that are not changing, so alignment with  the processes defined in the business architecture must also be considered. Whatever  is proposed must be within the competencies of the organisation and its personnel, or  there must be a plan for the development of these competencies.",705,113,176.25
197,"Finally, many sectors  are now heavily regulated and the proposed solution must be one that will be acceptable  to the regulators and not infringe other law or treaty obligations. In assessing technical feasibility, one is normally – though not necessarily – considering  IT. The proposed solution must meet the organisation’s demands in terms of system  performance, availability, reliability, maintainability and security. It must be asked if the  solution is scalable, up or down, if the circumstances of the organisation change. The  organisation must possess the technical skills to implement the solution, or supplement  these with help from outside.",656,98,164.0
197,"Few IT systems are now completely detached from other  systems and so the issue of compatibility must be considered. If the solution involves an  off-the-shelf software package, thought should be given to the amount of customisation  that would be required and whether this would cause technical difficulties. Finally,  consideration is needed regarding whether the proposed solution is a proven one or  places excessive reliance on leading edge – that is to say, unproven – technologies. Many  organisations would prefer a less ambitious but reliable solution to a more advanced  one that comes with a lot of technological risk. Financial feasibility is about whether the organisation can afford the proposed solution.",719,110,179.75
197," There may already be a budget imposed. The organisation needs either to have the  required funds available or to be in a position to borrow them. Every organisation will  have some rules or guidelines about what constitutes an acceptable return on its  investment and methods of calculating this are considered later in this chapter. Even if a  project pays for itself in the end, it may have unacceptable high costs on the way and so  cash flow must also be considered. Finally, all organisations specify some time period  over which payback must occur and, in the case of IT projects, the payback periods are  often very short, sometimes within the same accounting year as the investment.",691,116,172.75
197,"Another tool that can be used in assessing feasibility is a PESTLE analysis. PESTLE  examines the environment outside an organisation, or perhaps within an organisation  but outside the area being studied. It can be used to assess feasibility like this: yy Political: Is the proposed solution politically acceptable? yy Economic: Can the organisation afford the solution? yy Socio-cultural: Does the solution fit with the organisation’s culture?",445,66,111.25
197,"yy Technological: Can the solution be achieved, technically? yy Legal: Is it legal, will the regulator allow it? yy Environmental: Does it raise any ‘green’ environmental issues? A final tool that can be employed to assess the feasibility of an option is a ‘force-field  analysis’, illustrated in Figure 9.5. 167",312,50,78.0
198,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Figure 9.5  Force-field analysis Figure 9 . 5 With a force-field analysis, we consider those forces inside and outside the organisation  that will support adoption of the proposal and those that will oppose it; and we need  to be sure that the positive forces outweigh the negative. The forces may include the  PESTLE factors mentioned above, the elements identified in Figure 9.4 and also the key  stakeholders in the organisation (see Chapter 6). If we conclude that the negative forces  are just too strong, then the proposal is not feasible and must be abandoned or re-cast  in a way that gets more positive forces behind it. In considering the feasibility of options, we also need to think about their impacts and  risks.",744,124,186.0
198,"Because these form part of the business case itself, we discuss them later in this  chapter. STRUCTURE OF A BUSINESS CASE Organisations differ in how they like to have business cases presented. Some like large,  weighty documents with full analyses of the proposals and all the supporting data.  Others like a short, sharp presentation of the main points – we have come across one  organisation that mandates that business cases be distilled into a single page of A4.  If this sounds cavalier, remember that the people who have to make the decisions on  business cases are busy senior managers, whose time is at a premium.",622,105,155.5
198,"Whatever their  size, however, the structure and content of most business cases are similar and tend to  include these elements: yy introduction; yy management summary; yy description of the current situation; yy options considered; yy analysis of costs and benefits; yy impact assessment; yy risk assessment; 168",313,47,78.25
199,"MAKING A BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CASE yy recommendations; yy appendices, with supporting information. We shall examine each of these elements in turn. Introduction This sets the scene and explains why the business case is being presented. Where  relevant, it should also describe the methods used to examine the business issue and  acknowledge those who have contributed to the study. Management summary In many ways, this is the most important part of the document as it is possibly the only  part that the senior decision-makers will study properly.",550,87,137.5
199,"It should be written after the  rest of the document has been completed and should distill the whole of the business  case into a few paragraphs. In an ideal situation, three paragraphs should suffice: yy What the study was about and what was found out about the issues under  consideration. yy A survey of the options considered, with their principal advantages and dis- advantages. yy A clear statement of the recommendation being made and the decision required. If you cannot get away with only three paragraphs, try at least to restrict the management  summary to one or two pages.",585,99,146.25
199," Description of the current situation This section of the document discusses the current situation and explains where the  problems and opportunities lie. As long as these issues are covered to a sufficient  level of detail, it is good to keep this section as short as possible; senior managers  often complain of having to read pages and pages to find out what they knew already!  Sometimes, though, the real problems or opportunities uncovered are not what  management thought they were when they instituted the study. In that case, more space  will have to be devoted to clarifying the issues and exploring the implications for the  business. Options considered In this section of the document, the options to be considered are described with a brief  explanation of why we are rejecting those not recommended.",813,132,203.25
199,"More coverage should be  devoted to describing the recommended solution and why we are recommending it. As  represented in Figure 9.3, there may well be a series of incremental options, from the  most basic one to one that addresses all of the issues raised. 169",262,45,65.5
200,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Analysis of costs and benefits Cost–benefit analysis is one of the most interesting – and also the most difficult –  aspects of business case development. Before examining the subject in detail, it is worth  mentioning that it is good psychology to present the benefits before the costs. Doing this  will increase the expectations of the likely costs and will help the decision-makers to  appreciate the benefits before they are told the costs of achieving them. In other words,  what we are presenting is actually a benefit–cost analysis even though by convention it  is always referred to as a cost–benefit analysis. Although cost–benefit analysis is interesting, it does pose a number of challenges: yy working out in the first place where costs will be incurred and where benefits  can be expected; yy being realistic about whether the benefits will be realised in practice; yy placing a value on intangible elements like ‘improved customer satisfaction’ or  ‘better staff morale’.",1003,159,250.75
200,"The last point concerns the types of costs and benefits that need to be considered. Costs  and benefits are either incurred, or enjoyed, immediately or in the longer term. They  are also either tangible, which means that a credible – usually monetary – value can be  placed on them, or intangible, where this is not the case. Combining these elements, we  find that costs and benefits fit into one of four categories, as illustrated in Figure 9.6. Figure 9.6  Categories of costs and benefits Figure 9.6 Costs tend to be mainly tangible, whereas benefits are often a mixture of the tangible and  intangible.",607,103,151.75
200,"In some organisations, the managers will not consider intangible benefits at  all and this often makes it difficult – or even impossible – to make an effective business  case. How, for instance, does one place a value on something like a more modern  company image achieved through adopting a new logo? In theory, it should be possible  to put a numeric value on any cost or benefit; the practical problem is that we seldom  have the time, or the specialist expertise – for example, from the field of operational  research – to do so. 170",538,95,134.5
201,"MAKING A BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CASE If intangible benefits are allowed, though, it is very important not to over-state them or,  worse, to put some spurious value against them. The danger here is that the decision- makers simply do not believe this value and this then undermines their confidence in  other, more soundly based, values. With intangible benefits, it is a much better policy to  state what they are and even to emphasise them but to leave the decision-makers to  put their own valuations on them. Another pitfall in cost–benefit analysis is to base them on assumptions. For example,  we might say something like ‘If we could achieve a 20% reduction in the time taken to  produce invoices, this would amount to 5,000 hours per year or a cost saving of £25,000.’",775,132,193.75
201," This will only prove acceptable to the decision-makers if the assumption is plausible. If  you can, use assumptions that are common within the organisation and always err on  the side of conservatism, which is to under-claim rather than over-claim. Looking at the four categories of costs and benefits already described, there are  some areas where costs and benefits typically arise and there are standard ways of  quantifying them.  Tangible costs yy Development staff costs: In many projects, particularly those that involve  developing new processes or IT systems, these will be a major cost element. To  work them out, we need a daily rate for the staff concerned – probably available  from HR or Finance – and an outline project plan showing when and how many  of the resources will be required.",802,131,200.5
201,"If you are using external consultants, then the  costs here will be subject to negotiation and contract. yy User staff costs: These are often forgotten but can be significant. User staff  will have to be available for the initial investigation and analysis, possibly  during the development of new systems, to conduct user acceptance testing  and to be trained in the new systems and work practices. Again, daily rates  can be used in combination with an outline plan of the amount of user  involvement. yy Equipment: Where IT is involved, there will often be a need to purchase new  hardware.",593,99,148.25
201,"For this, estimates or quotations can be obtained from potential  suppliers. Other equipment may also be required such as desks, tables. yy Infrastructure: This includes elements like cabling and networks and, again,  estimates will be required from suppliers. yy Packaged software: Estimates of the cost of this can be obtained from package  vendors, probably based on the proposed number of users or licenses. Where  tailoring of a package is envisaged, estimates of the effort and cost involved  can be requested also.",521,81,130.25
201,"yy Relocation: This can be quite difficult to cost. The costs could include those  of the new premises, either rented or bought, refurbishment and the actual  moving costs. There may also be costs associated with surrendering existing  leases and so on. yy Staff training and retraining: To work this out, we need to know how many  people need to be trained and what they need to learn. Ideally, this requires  171",414,71,103.5
202,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS 	 training needs analysis which examines the skills gaps and identifies the  best way of developing the additional skills. If an assessment of the effort  required to develop training material is needed, a rough estimate may be  developed by multiplying the delivery time for a course by a factor of 10. For  example, a 2-day training event will typically require 20 days development  effort. yy Ongoing costs: Once any new systems are in place, they will require  maintenance and support, and quotations for this can be obtained from the  vendors. If this is not possible, a very rough rule of thumb is to allow support  costs of 15 per cent of operational costs in the first year after installation  and then 10 per cent thereafter.",752,126,188.0
202,"But this is very crude and actual quotations  are much to be preferred if they can be obtained. Intangible costs yy Disruption and loss of productivity: However good a new process or system  is in the long run, there is bound to be some disruption as it is introduced. The  level of disruption is very difficult to predict when implementing any business  change. Also, if parallel running of old and new IT systems is used to smooth  the transition, there will be a tangible cost involved as well. yy Recruitment: This ought to be tangible but organisations often have little idea  of the total cost to recruit someone although elements of this cost, such as  agency fees, will be tangible.",690,120,172.5
202,"But if new staff or skills are needed, there will be  costs involved in getting the new staff and inducting them into the organisation. Tangible benefits yy Staff savings: This is the most obvious saving, though many organisations are  now so lean that it is hard to see where further reductions will come from.  In calculating the savings, we need the total cost of employing the people  concerned – including things like national insurance, pensions and other benefits  and sometimes the space they occupy. The HR or accounts departments should  be able to supply this information. Do not forget, though, that if people are to  be made redundant, there will be one-off redundancy costs that must be set  against the ongoing saved staff costs.",744,124,186.0
202,"yy Reduced effort and improved speed of working: If staff posts are not completely  removed, it may be possible to carry out some tasks in a shorter timescale thus  freeing up time for other work. This is a tangible benefit if the effort to carry  out the task is measured and compared with the expected situation after the  change. yy Faster responses to customers: Again, it would be necessary to make a pre- change measurement of the time taken to respond to customers’ needs in order  to quantify any possible benefits. yy Reduced accommodation costs: These may have already been factored into the  cost of employing staff (see ‘Staff savings’ above) but new hardware may also  save space and, perhaps, people may be able to work from home some or all of  172",763,133,190.75
203,"MAKING A BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CASE 	 the time. The facilities or finance department should have some idea about the  cost of accommodation. yy Reduced inventory: New systems – especially ‘just in time’ systems – usually  result in the need to hold less stock. Finance and logistics experts should be  able to help in quantifying this benefit. yy Other costs reductions: These include things like reduced overtime working,  the ability to avoid basing staffing levels on workload peaks, reductions in time  and costs spent on travel between sites and in the use of consumables.",578,93,144.5
203,"Intangible benefits yy Increased job satisfaction: This may result in tangible benefits like reduced  staff turnover or absenteeism but the problem is that we cannot prove in  advance that these things will happen. yy Improved customer satisfaction: This, too, is intangible unless we have sound  measures to show, for example, why customers complain about our products  or services. yy Better management information: It is important to distinguish between  better management information and an increased amount of management  information. Better information should lead to better decisions but it is difficult  to value. yy Greater organisational flexibility: This means that the organisation can  respond more quickly to changes in the external environment, through having  more flexible systems and staff who can be switched to different work relatively  quickly.",866,126,216.5
203,"yy More problem-solving time: Managers freed from much day-to-day work  should have more time to study strategic and tactical issues. yy Improved presentation or better market image: New systems often enable an  organisation to present itself better to the outside world. yy Better communications: Many people report that poor communications within  their organisation are a problem so improving communications would clearly  be beneficial. However, again, it would be difficult to place a value on this. Avoided costs One particular form of benefit, which is worth thinking about, is what we might call  ‘avoided costs’.",621,94,155.25
203,"For example, in the run-up to the year 2000, many organisations  were faced with the costs of making their computer systems millennium-compliant.  IT departments often instead suggested the wholesale replacement of systems,  thereby avoiding the costs of adapting the old systems. In such a case, an investment  of, say, £2 million in a new system might be contrasted with an avoided cost of £1  million just to make the old legacy systems compliant. There are often situations  where an organisation has to do something and has already budgeted for it; that  budget can be offset against a more radical solution that would offer additional  business benefits. 173",664,107,166.0
204,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Presenting the financial costs and benefits Once the various tangible costs and benefits have been assessed, they need to be  presented so that management can see whether and when the project pays for itself. As  this is a somewhat complex topic, it is examined separately in the section ‘Investment  appraisal’. Impact assessment In addition to the costs and benefits already mentioned, for each of the options we need  to explore in the business case any impacts that there might be on the organisation.  Some of these impacts may have costs attached to them but some may not and are  simply the things that may happen as a result of adopting the proposed course of action.  Examples include: yy Organisation structure: It may be necessary to reorganise departments or  functions to exploit the new circumstances properly.",842,137,210.5
204,"For example, to create a  single point of contact for customers or more generalist rather than specialist  staff roles. This will naturally be unsettling for the staff and managers involved  and a plan must be made to handle this. yy Interdepartmental relations: Similarly, the relationships between departments  may change and there may be a need to introduce service level agreements or  in other ways redefine these relationships. yy Working practices: New processes and systems invariably lead to changes in  working practices and these must be introduced carefully and sensitively. yy Management style: Sometimes, the style that managers adopt has to change.",663,101,165.75
204," For example, if we de-layer the organisation and give front-line staff more  authority to deal with customers, their managers’ role changes as well. yy Recruitment policy: The organisation may have to recruit different types of  people and look for different skills. yy Appraisal and promotion criteria: It may be necessary to change people’s  targets and incentives in order to encourage them to display different  behaviours, for example to be more customer-focused. yy Supplier relations: These may have to be redefined. For example, outsourcing  IT services would work much better with a co-operative customer/supplier  relationship than with the adversarial situation that too often seems to exist.",704,105,176.0
204,"Whatever the impacts are, the business case needs to spell them out. It must also make  clear to the decision-makers what changes will have to be made in order to fully exploit  the opportunities available, and the costs these changes are likely to incur. Risk assessment No change comes without risk and it is unrealistic to think otherwise. A business case  is immeasurably strengthened if it can be shown that the potential risks have been  identified and that suitable countermeasures are available. A comprehensive risk log  (sometimes called the risk register) is probably not required at this stage – that should  174",624,102,156.0
205,"MAKING A BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CASE be created when the change or development project proper starts – but the principal  risks should be identified. For each risk, the following should be recorded: yy Description: The cause of the risk should be described and also its impact,  for example ‘uncertainty over the future leads to the resignation of key staff,  leaving the organisation with a lack of experienced personnel’. yy Impact assessment: This should attempt to assess the scale of the damage that  would be suffered if the risk occurred. If quantitative measures can be made,  so much the better, otherwise a scale of ‘small, ‘moderate’ or ‘large’ will suffice. yy Probability: How likely is it that this risk will materialise?",735,120,183.75
205,"Again, precise  probabilities can be calculated but it is probably better to use a scale of ‘low’,  ‘medium’ or ‘high’. yy Countermeasures: This is the really important part, the question being what  can we do to either reduce the likelihood of the risk occurring or lessen its  impact if it does. We may also try to transfer the risk’s impact onto someone  else, for example through the use of insurance. yy Ownership: For each risk, we need to decide who would be best placed to take  the necessary countermeasures. This may involve asking senior managers  within the organisation to take the responsibility.",610,102,152.5
205,"If there seem too many risks associated with the proposal, it is a good idea to document  only the major ones – the potential ‘show-stoppers’ – in the body of the business case  and to put the rest in an appendix. Recommendations Finally, we need to summarise the business case and make clear the decisions that  the senior managers are being asked to take. If the business case is for carrying out  a project of some sort, then an outline of the main tasks and timescales envisaged is  useful to the decision-makers. This is best expressed graphically, as a Gantt/bar chart  as illustrated in Figure 9.7. Figure 9.7  Gantt/bar chart for a proposed project Figure 9.7 175",671,117,167.75
206,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Appendices and supporting information Where detailed information needs to be included in the business case, this is best put  into appendices. This separates out the main points, that are put in the main body of the  case, from the supporting detail. If supporting statistics have to be provided, they too  should go into appendices, perhaps with a summary graph or chart in the main body.  The detailed cost–benefit calculations may also be put into appendices. INVESTMENT APPRAISAL In this part of the business case, the financial aspects – in other words the tangible  costs and benefits – are contrasted so see if, and when, the project will pay for itself.",679,112,169.75
206," The simplest way of doing this is by using what is called a ‘payback’ calculation, which  is in effect a cash-flow forecast for the project. An example of a payback calculation is  given in Table 9.1. It shows immediate costs of £200,000 for hardware and £150,000 for  software for a new system, and ongoing costs of £30,000 for hardware maintenance  and £30,000 for software support and upgrades. The tangible benefit will be the removal  of some clerical posts, valued at £150,000 per year. Note that, in these calculations, the  convention is to refer to the year in which the investment is made as ‘Year 0’.",612,105,153.0

By working  out the cumulative positions, we discover that the accumulated benefits finally exceed  the accumulated costs in Year 3 and thereafter build up at £90,000 per year. Payback calculations have the virtue of being easy to understand and relatively  easy to construct, although getting reliable figures can sometimes be a headache.  176",978,141,244.5
207,"MAKING A BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CASE Where interest rates and inflation are low they provide a reasonable forecast of what  will happen. However, they do not take account of what accountants call the ‘time  value of money’. This is the simple fact – which we all understand from our personal  experience – that money spent or saved today is not worth the same as it will be next  year or in five years’ time. In part this is the effect of inflation but, even with low or zero  inflation, there are other things that we could do with the money besides investing in  this project. We might, for instance, leave it in the bank to earn interest.",641,117,160.25
207,"Or, conversely,  we might have to borrow money and pay interest to finance the project. A method that takes account of the time value of money is known as discounted cash  flow (DCF) which leads to a ‘net present value’ (NPV) for the project. This means that all of  the cash-flows in years after Year 0 are adjusted to today’s value of money. Management  accountants work out the ‘discount rate’ to use in a discounted cash flow calculation by  studying a number of factors including the likely movement of money-market interest  rates in the next few years. The mechanism for doing this is outside the scope of this  book but interested readers are referred to the ‘Further reading’ section at the end  of this chapter.",721,125,180.25
207,"Let us suppose, though, that the management accountants decide  we should be using a discount rate of 10 per cent. We can then find the amounts by  which we should discount the cash-flows in Years 1 to 4 either by using the appropriate  formula in a spreadsheet or looking up the factors in an accounting text-book. For a  10 per cent discount rate, the relevant factors are shown in Table 9.2.

This is a calculation that assesses what sort of return on investment  is represented by the project in terms of a single percentage figure. This can then be  used to compare projects one with another to see which are the better investment  opportunities, and to compare them all with what the same money could earn if just left  in the bank. So, for example, if the IRR of a project is calculated at three per cent and  current bank interest rates are five per cent, then on financial grounds alone it would  be better not to spend the money.",782,143,195.5
208,"IRR is worked out by standing the DCF/NPV calculations on their head. The question we  are asking is, what discount rate would we have to use to get a net present value of zero  after five years (or whatever period the organisation mandates should be used for the  calculation)? In other words, at what point would financial costs and benefits precisely  balance each other? One way of calculating the IRR is by trial and error. For example,  setting up a spreadsheet and trying different discount rates until an NPV of zero is  produced – Microsoft Office Excel has an automated function to do this.",600,104,150.0
208,"In the case of  our example project, the IRR is around 14.42 per cent. If this were being compared with  another project offering only five per cent, then our project would be the more attractive  one. However, IRR does not take account of the overall size of the project, so that the  project with the smaller IRR may produce more actual pounds, or euros or dollars in the  end. For this reason, most accounting textbooks agree that DCF/NPV is the best method  of assessing the value of an investment, whilst acknowledging that many managers like  the simplicity of the single-figure IRR. PRESENTATION OF A BUSINESS CASE There are two basic ways in which a business case can be presented and often there is  a need for both: as a written document and as a face-to-face presentation.",783,136,195.75
208,"In both cases,  the way the business case is presented can often have a major impact on whether it is  accepted or not and there are some simple rules that apply to both approaches: yy Think about the audience: Readers of reports and attendees at presentations  have a variety of interests and attitudes. Some like to have all of the details,  others prefer an overview. As far as possible, try to address the concerns of  each of the decision-makers in the report or presentation. ( See the information  in Chapter 6 on stakeholder management, for more on this.) yy Keep it short: You may have to use a pre-set format or template for your report,  in which case the actual sections may force you into a long document.",718,128,179.5
208,"However,  try as far as possible to keep the business case concise. yy Consider the structure: We have provided here a good basic structure for a  written business case. For a presentation, the old rule still holds good: ß tell ’em what you’re going to tell ’em; ß tell ’em; ß tell ’em what you’ve told ’em. 178",314,58,78.5
209,"MAKING A BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CASE You need to build to a logical conclusion that starts with the current situation and  leads to the decision you need made. yy Think about appearances: Again, you may be constrained by a template here  but, if not, remember you have to induce the decision-makers to read your  business case! Use lots of white space, pictures and diagrams instead of tables,  and use colour as well. For a presentation, avoid dozens of bullet-point slides,  which tend to simply repeat what is in the report anyway; instead use pictures,  diagrams and colour to provide a more visual representation for the decision- makers. RAID AND CARDI LOGS We have seen that the business case documents the risks of a proposed project and it  also may set out any constraints, assumptions or dependencies on which it has been  based.",840,142,210.0
209,"Since all of these will have ongoing effects throughout the project, this is a good  point at which to set up logs that will assist us in managing these factors. A RAID log  documents risks, assumptions, issues and dependencies; a CARDI log includes these  elements plus constraints. A CARDI log therefore contains sections that document: yy Constraints: The main constraints on any project are those of the ‘iron triangle’  – time, cost (or resources) and product/quality. But other constraints may  need to be taken into account as well, such as the need to comply with certain  legislation, to use certain standards or to make sure an IT solution runs on a  specific platform. yy Assumptions: The business case, and thus the project, may rest on certain  assumptions, for example that government funding may be available for part  of the project.",849,140,212.25
209,"These assumptions should be documented and actions identified  to test whether they are valid. yy Risks: The risks documented in the business case form the start of the overall  risk log for the project and will be added to as more is known about it. The log  should document the risks themselves, their probability of occurrence and scale  of impact, the actions proposed to avoid or mitigate them and who should own  each risk. As well as new risks arising during the project, others will change and  still more can be retired if they do not, in fact, occur. yy Dependencies: Because modern organisations are so complex, an individual  project often has dependencies on other projects, or may be depended upon by  other projects.",731,124,182.75
209,"For instance, a project to introduce a new IT system may depend  on a project to recruit people to operate it and vice versa. Capturing details of  these dependencies makes sure that they are kept in mind at all times. yy Issues: An issue is something that has occurred on a project which could have  an effect on it (for good or ill) and which therefore needs to be managed. Some  issues are risks which have materialised. For example, if it is known at the  outset that the project team is inexperienced, this is an issue rather than a risk  because it has 100 per cent probability of occurring.",597,109,149.25

Since a CARDI/RAID log is established at the time the initial business case is created, its  entries will probably be at a high-level at this stage and then gain detail as the project  proceeds and more is known about its complexities. SUMMARY A coherent and well-researched business case should be an important guiding document  for any change project. Developing a business case starts by identifying the possible  options and then assessing their feasibility. The business case itself follows a fairly  clearly defined format, leading to clear recommendations to the decision-makers.",722,113,180.5

A CARDI/RAID log can be used to document  important information about factors that could affect the success of the project. At a  designated point after the project has been completed, the business case should form  the basis for a review to determine whether the expected benefits have been realised  in practice and to identify any actions required to support the delivery of those benefits;  this is discussed in Chapter 14.

The needs come out in a rush, a mixture  of complaints, design decisions, interface descriptions, current situations, and from  time to time specific human–machine interface requirements. It is sometimes  possible to isolate chunks of this as definite functions. In short, there seems to be a  gap between theory and practice. Theory says that on the one hand we’ll find people  who state what they want, and on the other, people who make things to please the  first bunch of people.",668,112,167.0
211,"Instead, all the people and tasks and documents seem to be  muddled up together. Ian Alexander (2004) Most analysts involved in defining user requirements will probably recognise Alexander’s  description. Requirements, apparently regarded by business users as the uncomplicated  area of a new systems development, are actually the most problematic aspect, and yet,  the time allocated is often far less than for the other phases. Requirements Engineering  (RE) is the Information Systems (IS) industry’s response to the problem of requirements  for new systems not being met, or even not being offered clearly in the first place. Tight  timescales and tight budgets – both the result of constraints on the business – place  pressures on the development team to deliver a product.",779,120,194.75
211,"However, without sufficient  time to understand and define the requirements properly, the product that is delivered  on time may not provide the solution that the business thought had been requested.  Applying the process of requirements engineering should help to rectify these problems. As many organisations are adopting an Agile mode of software development, there  are new pressures on the requirements phase, where an IT systems forms part of the  solution. Agile works to a completely different philosophy from the linear waterfall- based methods, and the approach chosen must be tailored accordingly. While the stages  set out in the RE framework are still applicable, the level of detail defined about the  requirements may be varied.",743,114,185.75
211,"Agile development adopts the principle of ‘just in time’  requirements. So although high-level requirements are required right from the start, the  level of detail for those requirements evolves just in time. For example, at the beginning  of a project, the requirements document may contain some high-level process models  and a set of general business and technical requirements, supplemented by a use  case diagram showing the scope of the proposed IT system. Once initial requirements  have been prioritised, outline use case descriptions can be developed for the high- priority requirements and then more detailed requirements regarding the solution can  be elaborated later during development. In essence, the level of detail defined for the  181",752,113,188.0
212,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS requirements, and the approach to the documentation, should be tailored according to  the philosophy and approach to be adopted for the solution. Agile does not mean ‘just do  it’, and an equal rigour must be enforced when working in this environment.  A similar approach to requirements definition may be adopted when the solution is  to be an off-the-shelf software package. It may not be worthwhile documenting the  requirements in exhaustive detail as the package will impose some constraints.  However, it will be important to produce a requirements document that has enough  information to evaluate the package and ensure that there is sufficient ‘fit’ with the  requirements.",700,108,175.0
212," THE PROBLEMS WITH REQUIREMENTS Studies carried out into IS project failures over the last 30 years tell a common story.  The problems highlighted included: yy a large proportion of errors (over 80 per cent) are introduced at the requirements  analysis stage; yy very few faults, (fewer than 10 per cent) are introduced at the development stage  – developers are programming things right, but frequently not programming the  right things; yy most of the project time is allocated to the development and testing phases of  the project; yy less than 12 per cent of the project time is allocated to the requirements  analysis phase; yy there is poor alignment of the developed system to business strategy and  objectives; yy there is poor requirements management. These findings are particularly significant because the cost of correcting errors in  requirements increases dramatically if they are discovered as the work progresses  further through the development lifecycle. And yet, the studies quoted above identify  requirements analysis as the most error-prone stage of the development lifecycle. Walia and Carver (2009) identified over 90 causes of requirements errors in a meta- study they carried out on 149 papers.",1220,190,305.0
212,Typical problems with requirements that these  causes have brought about include: yy lack of relevance to the objectives of the project; yy lack of clarity in the wording; yy ambiguity; yy duplication and overlap across requirements; yy conflicts between requirements; 182,272,41,68.0
213,"ESTABLISHING THE REQUIREMENTS yy requirements expressed in such a way that it is difficult to assess whether or  not they have been achieved; yy requirements that assume a solution, rather than stating what is to be delivered  by the system; yy uncertainty amongst business users about what they need from the new  system; yy business users failing to identify all requirements; yy inconsistent levels of detail; yy business users and analysts taking certain knowledge for granted and failing  to ensure that there is a common understanding. The first point often results from a lack of terms of reference for the project. Clearly  defined terms of reference are essential to ensure that everyone involved in defining  the requirements understands the objectives, scope and constraints within which the  project is to be carried out. A useful mnemonic for the terms of reference is OSCAR.  This stands for: yy Objectives – both business and project objectives should be defined.",978,156,244.5
213,"yy Scope – the aspects to be covered, typically defined by specifying the activities  and deliverables of the project, as well as the functional areas to be included. It  is equally important to specify those areas NOT to be covered, in order to guard  against scope creep during the exercise.  yy Constraints – the budget, timescale and standards to which the project must  adhere. yy Authority – the business authority for the project, thus ensuring that there is  an ultimate arbiter to handle any conflicts between business users and their  requirements. The authority is also responsible for accepting the deliverables  from the project.",642,103,160.5
213,"yy Resources – the people and equipment available to the project. Requirements are often overlooked because they are omitted by the business user.  This is usually an oversight rather than mischief, and results from a belief that the  need is so self-evident they take it for granted that the analyst will understand  that. The difficulty associated with taking some knowledge for granted is by no  means trivial, and in a world of new business practices, business processes and  new technology, by no means uncommon. The business analyst is the person who  must help the business staff to visualise precisely what they need the new system to  perform, and then to articulate it.",679,112,169.75
213,"Another source of difficulties for the business analyst is recognising the different  stakeholder viewpoints. Depending upon their role in the organisation, one person might  see the business system as supporting the product, while another may think in terms of  finding a ‘marketing solution’; a third may see the system as being customer-focused.  All three are describing their perceptions of the same system, but each sits in his or her  own silo, viewing the business from that one viewpoint. It is up to the business analyst  183",535,86,133.75
214,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS to draw the threads together to view the system as a whole, and to meet all three  perspectives as well as possible. Chapter 6 discusses the CATWOE technique and its  use in analysing stakeholder perspectives.  Figure 10.1 illustrates the problem of perspectives with an illustration taken from  Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations.  Figure 10.1  The duckrabbitFigure 10.1 If the creature is perceived as looking to the left, it is clearly seen as a duck; if it is seen  as looking towards the right, however, it is clearly a rabbit. What it is not, though, is  both a duck and a rabbit.",613,101,153.25
214,"Wittgenstein named this ambiguous animal a duckrabbit. The  business analyst will encounter many duckrabbits during his or her career: a sales  director who sources products to satisfy customer demands sees the company as a  sales organisation, while a finance director who has invested heavily in an in-house  manufacturing capability will see a manufacturing organisation. They are describing  the same company, but one sees a duck, the other a rabbit. Is the company there to  provide satisfaction to its customers (a duck) or to sell its manufactured products (a  rabbit)? The analyst or requirements engineer needs to understand all of these valid  perspectives, or ‘world views’ (as described in Chapter 6) to be sure of capturing more  than a one-sided view.",765,120,191.25
214,"Recognising the existence of a duckrabbit, or multiple world  views, helps to anticipate scoping issues and potential requirements conflicts before  they arise. Another problem that business analysts face is an apparent inability on the part of the  business users to articulate clearly what it is they wish the system to do for them. Some  users, perhaps due to uncertainty, may even be reluctant to state their requirements.  Very often they are deterred from doing so because the nature of the requirement is not  susceptible to a straightforward statement. These issues may be due, at least in part,  to the problem of tacit knowledge; we shall explore some of these issues in the section  on ‘Requirements elicitation’.",724,116,181.0
214,184,3,1,0.75
215,"ESTABLISHING THE REQUIREMENTS A FRAMEWORK FOR REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING In the same way that ‘software engineering’ suggests a more structured and  scientific approach to the development of software than is implied by the older term  ‘programming’, so requirements engineering encapsulates a more disciplined and  rigorous approach to requirements definition. The business analyst must understand  and document requirements carefully in order to avoid the mistakes and oversights  identified above. To achieve this rigour, the business analyst should follow a roadmap  that guides them through the key steps required to develop a well-defined requirements  document. Figure 10.2 illustrates the requirements engineering framework, which  provides such a road map.  Figure 10.2  Requirements engineering framework Figure 10.2 Requirements elicitation is concerned with drawing out information and requirements  from the business stakeholders.",940,126,235.0
215,"This is done using the techniques described in  Chapter 5, which provides a toolkit of techniques to undertake requirements elicitation  effectively. When we elicit requirements from the users they are often explained with a  lack of clarity and completeness. Before the requirements are formally entered into a  requirements document, the business analyst needs to subject the initial requirements  list to careful scrutiny in order to ensure that they are well-formed. This is done during  the requirements analysis stage which focuses on examining and organising the elicited  requirements. This may involve identifying requirements that overlap, are in conflict  with other requirements or are duplicates.",709,103,177.25
215,"It may also involve separating out composite  descriptions into individual requirements. Once the set of unique requirements  have been identified, it is important to check them against the business objectives;  if a requirement is not supporting the achievement of a business objective then it is  questionable that it is required. In requirements analysis, the business analyst has a  gatekeeper role, ensuring only those requirements that pass the scrutiny will be entered  in the document. This activity highlights any areas requiring further elicitation and, in  turn, the additional information gleaned will be subject to analysis. This iterative process  185",665,98,166.25
216,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS continues until the analyst is content that the requirements have been defined to the  desired level of detail and quality. Requirements validation involves the external stakeholders reviewing the requirements  in order to agree and sign off the requirements document. The requirements catalogue is  one part of the full requirements document, which also contains models of the business  processes and IT system. This document should be analysed and checked by the  business analyst for completeness and consistency. Once the document is considered  to be complete, it must be reviewed by business representatives and confirmed to  be a true statement of the required system; at this point the document is said to be  ‘signed off’ or ‘baselined’.",764,117,191.0
216,"During this stage the reviewers examine the requirements and  question whether they are well defined, clear and complete. The review will be similar to  that undertaken in the analysis stage, but this time it is the business stakeholders who  will carry out the checks rather than the analysts.  These three aspects – requirements elicitation, requirements analysis and requirements  validation – are described in further detail below. There are two other aspects that complete the requirements engineering work:  requirements documentation is concerned with the development of a well-organised  requirements document; requirements management covers the activities needed to  manage any changes to the requirements. Changes occur throughout the business  change and solution development lifecycles, and procedures need to be in place to  deal with them.",853,123,213.25
216,"Whatever the reason, the business analyst must record, analyse and  action the changes and ensure that every requirement is fully traceable from the  initial recording to sign-off during user acceptance testing. Chapter 11 discusses the  development and structure of the requirements document, the issue of traceability and  the use of software tools to support requirements management. The approaches to  developing the models of the IT system are described in Chapter 12. ACTORS An actor is an individual or group who is fulfilling a particular role.

The role of the SME is to give business advice regarding the requirements. Particular  situations when this may be relevant are: yy the requirements cover more than one business function; yy the requirements relate to a redesigned business process; yy the organisation wishes to introduce a new product or process that the company  does not yet fully understand; yy the organisation wishes to adopt the latest industry best practice.  The SME brings a breadth of understanding to RE, and should have experience and  knowledge of industry best practice.

217,"The SME may be an internal expert  or may be an external consultant, brought in for the duration of the project. While an  external SME can bring in fresh views and insights from industry, drawing on best  practice as used elsewhere, there are some risks associated with their use: yy They may not understand well how this particular company works, and  its specific culture.

This will help confirm the analysts’  understanding of the requirements, as well as encouraging the users to identify new  features they would like to see. REQUIREMENTS ELICITATION In the early days of systems analysis, this activity was often known as ‘requirements  capture’. The word ‘capture’ implies the existence of discrete entities called ‘requirements’  that were readily available to be spotted and caught.",758,115,189.5
219,"In those days most IT projects were  concerned with developing IT systems that would perform the tasks carried out by  people, mostly clerical staff. To that extent, each task performed by a person could be  regarded as a requirement, or set of requirements, to be delivered by the system, so  requirements capture was not an unreasonable term to use.  Nowadays, the rationale for developing or enhancing IT systems includes a need to  help the organisation gain a competitive advantage, to support new or re-engineered  business processes, or to install an enabling infrastructure. The more straightforward  approach of using the current procedures as a basis has declined and there is a strong  likelihood that the business users will not be at all clear about what they need the  system to provide. The term ‘capture’ is less suited to the reality of today’s business  world, and has been superseded by the term ‘elicitation’.",929,151,232.25
219," Whereas earlier approaches placed the onus on the business user to identify the  requirements, requirements elicitation is a proactive approach to uncovering the  requirements. It involves drawing out information from the users, helping them to  visualise the possibilities and articulate their requirements. The requirements emerge  as a result of the interaction between analyst and user with much proactive elicitation  on the part of the analyst.  When devising the strategy for elicitation for any given project, one consideration to take  into account is the type of knowledge the stakeholders are using. Tacit knowledge When developing a new system, the business users will pass on to us their explicit  knowledge; their knowledge of procedures and data that is at the front of their minds,  and which they can easily articulate.",837,128,209.25
219,"By tacit knowledge, we mean those other aspects  of the work that a stakeholder is unable to articulate or explain. The term derives from  the work of Michael Polanyi (2009) whose thesis is succinctly expressed in the maxim  ‘We can know more than we can tell.’ In terms of understanding requirements, there  are a number of elements to tacit knowledge that we must be aware of and recognise  when we encounter them.  Some common elements to this unspoken knowledge that cause problems and  misunderstandings are: 189",517,86,129.25

For  example, consider how you might convey the correct sequence of actions that would  be necessary to turn right at a roundabout on a dual carriageway. This would include  every touch or release of the pedals, in the correct sequence, every check of the mirror,  every gear change and every turn of the wheel, with the degree of turn. To build an  automated vehicle that could travel along roads without a driver would need all of this  information to be specified in detail. In practice, an experienced human driver would  not be able explain this accurately during an interview, largely because they perform  the task without having to rationalise each step; their bodies and limbs ‘know’ what  to do without the intervention of conscious thought.",855,140,213.75
220,"If we needed to document this  process, we would have to select a requirements elicitation approach that would help to  uncover information about these automatic actions. Protocol analysis is a powerful way  to explore these unconscious skills and gather the information to document them. This  technique involves the expert performing the task in discrete steps, talking through each  step as they make it, and repeating this two or three times. This is an approach often  used where skills are taught, for example, when children are taught to tie shoelaces,  learner drivers shown how to drive a car, and apprentices taught to use machines. Taken-for-granted information Even experienced and expert business users may fail to mention information or clarify  terminology and the analyst may not realise that further questioning is required.",841,130,210.25
220,"The  gap in our understanding may not emerge until user acceptance testing or even after  implementation and this may be costly and complex to correct. This issue has been  identified as a cause of many systems failures. This has also been termed ‘not-worth- mentioning’ information. This highlights that it is not through malice or intention that  the user fails to reveal some aspect of the procedure or documentation, simply that to  them it is so obvious that they take the analyst’s familiarity for granted. The fact that the  analyst then fails to ask a question on that aspect simply confirms to them that to talk  about it is unnecessary.",646,109,161.5
220,"It is often only at user acceptance testing, and sometimes even  later during deployment, that this gap becomes apparent. Front-story/back-story This issue concerns a tendency to frame a description of current working practices, or a  workplace, in order to give a more positive view than is actually the case. The business  user may do this in order to avoid reflecting badly on the staff or the organisation. An  analogy could be the swan gliding gracefully across the smooth surface of a lake (front- story) while below the surface its feet are paddling frantically (back-story) to sustain the  gentle momentum. This problem may occur if the analysts are perceived to represent  management and as a result, may be given the favourable front-story version of how the  business or department works.",799,129,199.75
220,"It is clearly important then that we build good working  relationships with the business users and encourage them to trust us so that we are  able to obtain details of the back-story of the reality of the business operation.  We should be most suspicious of a front story when we are told an operation runs very  smoothly without any problems, and if there are problems they are always easily dealt  with. Also, we might be concerned if we are told that the customers of that process are  always very happy with the results. While this could be the case it is always sensible to  probe a little deeper and ensure that there is quantifiable data to support the assertion.  190",675,120,168.75
221,"ESTABLISHING THE REQUIREMENTS The saying, ‘If it sounds too good to be true – it probably is’ is often found to be the case  in organisations. The analyst must avoid seeming sceptical about what they have been  told – after all, success lies in building a rapport with key stakeholders and earning their  trust. Nonetheless, the true story – the ‘back-story’ – will in all probability give a different  picture. Work shadowing, observation of the working environment, rich pictures, spaghetti  diagrams and process modelling are all techniques that help to clarify what really happens.  Conceptualising requirements  If the study is required to examine a new business system and there is a lack of expertise  and knowledge in our organisation, it is very difficult for the business stakeholders to  imagine what they require the solution to offer.",847,136,211.75
221,"We cannot ask them to demonstrate any  existing processes or procedures and yet it is important that we draw from them what  they need the solution to provide. While the information about the business context,  for example, the business strategy or the legal constraints, will provide a degree of  understanding, it will be extremely difficult to produce a more detailed definition of the  requirements. A good approach is to help the business users visualise for themselves  how the business processes could work and what IS support they will require. Providing  a visual representation will enable the business users to consider and articulate their  requirements more clearly. Approaches that would help with this include exploring  possibilities in a workshop, using business scenarios and story-telling workshops, or  enlisting the developers to build some initial prototypes to show what the IT system  might offer and how it might look. ‘",945,147,236.25
221,"Your finger, you fool’  This is based upon an apocryphal story and tells about a European explorer who  landed in the seventeenth century on an island and asked a native inhabitant the name  of a prominent mountain. He pointed at the landmark he was asking about, but the  islanders did not recognise the gesture of pointing to distant objects; the inhabitant  assumed that what he was being asked to identify was the outstretched finger.  This illustrates the difficulty of an outside party assuming that there is a common  language and that the common norms of communication apply. In such situations,  cultural and language differences may create many possibilities for confusion,  so we should consider whether an extended investigation might be required. An  ethnographic study can be an extremely useful technique in such situations although  it will require an extended period of time and a great deal of effort.",919,148,229.75
221,"However, without a  detailed investigation approach the analysts will not be sure that they have sufficient  understanding and knowledge to be able to define the business requirements. Without  this, the scope for misrepresentation of the situation can grow considerably. Intuitive understanding This is usually born of considerable experience. Decision-makers such as those working  in medical diagnosis or geological surveys, are often thought to follow a logical, linear  path of enquiry while making their decisions. In reality though, as individuals acquire  decision-making skills and technical knowledge, the linear approach is often abandoned  in favour of intuitive pattern recognition.",695,97,173.75
221,"Ask specialists why they made a particular  judgement and you may be told about the logical steps, but there will often be a point  where the logic ends and intuition takes over; this is where knowledge has been applied  at a tacit level rather than explicitly. Protocol analysis aided by drawing a decision tree  can help with understanding decisions, as can ethnographic studies. 191",385,64,96.25
222,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS With the exception of ‘front-story/back-story’, which is more of a reluctance to tell  than an inability to articulate, these issues all occur because of the application of an  individual’s tacit knowledge. However, there are situations where an organisation  possesses tacit knowledge and it is important for this to be recognised and understood.  Examples of organisational tacit knowledge include: yy Norms of behaviour and communication – these evolve over time in every  organisation. Any new process or system that threatens to conflict with these  norms may face resistance. yy Organisational culture – the culture of an organisation can be expressed through  the behaviour of the management and staff.",727,109,181.75
222,"The analyst needs to consider what  the behaviour says about the culture of the organisation and ensure that this is  taken into consideration when considering any business changes.  yy Organisation stories – there will always be a shared history of events that have  happened in the past. Some of these histories may relate to projects that failed  or succeeded in some more spectacular fashion, and about which stories and  in-jokes may have grown over the years. There could be important lessons to  learn from these histories, but they are only known by word of mouth, so an  analyst from outside may not be aware of this knowledge and make a faux pas  as a result. yy Formal and informal networks – these are discrete groups of workers who  may be related by task, or by department, by geographical location or some  other factor.",835,143,208.75
222,"They have their own sets of experience, norms and practices, and  as these are distinct from other groups within the organisation they are not  reflected in the organisation as a whole. A network is likely to have its own  body of tacit information, which the members understand well and are not  accustomed to sharing openly. If a systems development project involves cross- functional requirements, or is company-wide, then the understanding of the  networks is an important part of the elicitation process. Table 10.1 shows levels of both tacit and explicit knowledge.

223,"ESTABLISHING THE REQUIREMENTS Tacit knowledge must be made more explicit. To do this we need to choose techniques  to assist business users to articulate their tacit knowledge. Once they have articulated  the tacit knowledge, we need to make this knowledge explicit by documenting it and  disseminating it to the other members of the project team.  REQUIREMENTS ELICITATION TECHNIQUES There are a number of best practice techniques available to the analyst to help elicit  tacit knowledge and requirements from all levels of the organisation. Those used most  often are discussed in Chapter 5.",593,92,148.25
223," The process for eliciting tacit knowledge shown in Figure 10.3 identifies approaches for  uncovering tacit knowledge.

223,"This mapping of techniques to knowledge types provides a good  indication of where certain techniques can be particularly useful and where they can  still be useful but to a lesser extent. BUILDING THE REQUIREMENTS LIST  As we elicit the requirements from our various business stakeholders, we need to  document them.

This may be done at any time during elicitation while the list is being compiled. It can be  useful to ask another analyst, who was not present at the elicitation session, to scrutinise  the requirements as a fresh perspective can often identify clarifying questions that may  have been missed during the conversation with the stakeholder.

The requirements identified at  this stage will not be well-formed and the level and scope will vary considerably; some  may be detailed and specific whilst others will be defined at an overview level only or  may represent several potential requirements. The requirements list helps to ensure  that everything that is raised is documented and the source identified. This is vital to  embed traceability in the requirements.,658,103,164.5
225,"REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS Once a set of requirements has been elicited and entered onto the requirements list, the  next step in the requirements engineering framework can begin. This involves analysing  the individual requirements.  Requirements analysis is concerned with ensuring that all of the requirements  identified during requirements elicitation have been developed into clear, organised,  well-documented requirements. The separation of requirements elicitation from  requirements analysis is one of the strengths of requirements engineering. The analysts  are encouraged during elicitation to draw out information, uncover tacit knowledge and  identify requirements; during analysis, the business analysts examine the results of  this work in detail in order to develop the requirement documentation that will take  the project forward.",844,113,211.0
225,"Requirements analysis requires a high degree of logical thought,  organisation and rigour if the documentation is to be of the required standard. In this  instance, the analyst takes the role of a gatekeeper in order to ensure the quality of the  requirements. Only those requirements that are clearly stated, unambiguous, atomic,  feasible, aligned with the project objectives, not in conflict with any other requirements  and not overlapping with or duplicating other requirements, will be documented fully  for implementation.  195",534,79,133.5
226,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS In order to confirm that requirements are in scope, and also that the set of requirements  is complete, it is helpful to draw some models that incorporate all the requirements. A  use case diagram may be used to define the scope of the system and the features to  be delivered; a business process model may be used to illustrate how the work is to  be conducted and the flow of the process; a data model may be used to clarify the data  to be held and the business rules to be implemented. If the requirement does not fit  naturally into any of these three models it is probably out of scope. By cross-referring  the models to each other and to the requirements it should be possible to see where  there are omissions. For example, the analyst should check that there is a function for  creating, modifying, deleting and accessing the data shown on the data model.",882,158,220.5
226,"If any of  these functions are missing there may be a missing requirement, although it is possible  that the function is not in the scope of the system. Such omissions should at the least  prompt questions. The other reason for including the models is that diagrams can be  much easier to makes sense of than a catalogue of several hundred entries.  As this work is carried out, many additional questions will be raised and you may need  to investigate the requirements further using requirements elicitation techniques. Thus  an iterative cycle of requirements elicitation and analysis develops.",596,96,149.0
226," Requirements analysis includes the following tasks: yy Categorisation of the requirements – as a first pass at the analysis, the  requirements should be categorised into specific requirement types. There  are four major types of requirements: general (business), technical, functional  and non-functional requirements. These types are described in more detail  in Chapter 11. Further sub-groupings may be by business area or function,  or possibly by use case. Grouping requirements this way helps the analyst to  examine the related requirements as a coherent group.",568,82,142.0
226,"This helps check for  completeness of requirements, and makes it easier for a business stakeholder  to validate a particular set of requirements.  yy Drawing a set of models that reflect the requirements that have been elicited.  These models provide a check that the set is complete, coherent and that no  requirements have been omitted. The modelling techniques are described in  Chapter 12. yy Applying a series of filters in order to ensure that the requirements are well  defined.",485,78,121.25
226,"Requirements filters The following filters should be used to examine the requirements and build a well- formed, clearly documented requirements set. yy Checking for overlapping or duplicate requirements: once requirements that  cover a similar area are grouped together, it is much easier to find the duplicate  or overlapping requirements. Where there is duplication, the requirements  should be merged; where there are overlapping requirements they should  either be merged or separated into distinct requirements. yy Unravelling multiple requirements: some requirements may have been listed  that cover a number of different aspects rather than stating one requirement.  196",677,96,169.25
227,"ESTABLISHING THE REQUIREMENTS 	 It is important that these grouped requirements are split into individual, atomic  requirements. An example of a grouped requirement is: ‘the reservations clerk  must be able to record, amend or cancel a booking’. In fact, there are three  requirements here potentially with their own priority and acceptance criteria.  Each needs to be documented. yy Confirming relevance of the requirement: all requirements should be aligned  to the business and project objectives.",500,73,125.0
227,"They should also address a root cause of  a problem rather than just a symptom of a problem. If a requirement statement  does not support these areas it is likely that this is not actually a business need. yy Feasibility evaluation: all requirements should be evaluated to see if they  would be feasible. There are three aspects to feasibility – technical, business  and financial.  ß Technical feasibility is concerned with the availability of technology to fulfil  a requirement.",482,78,120.5
227,"Does the technology exist to satisfy the requirement, and is  it available to the organisation? If we already have the technology in place,  can it cope with the expected volumes and frequency of use? Is it sufficiently  robust and secure? ß Business feasibility concerns the likely level of acceptance of the requirement  by the business. Does it align with business objectives and strategy?",393,63,98.25
227,"Does it  match the organisational culture? Does it contribute to the critical success  factors? ß Financial feasibility involves considering how expensive it would be to meet  the requirement and consider if this is justified. Is the requirement within  the budget? If not, would the extra funding be available?",312,48,78.0
227,"What would be the  return on investing in this feature? Imagine a client asking an architect to  build a large swimming pool into a new house design without increasing  the cost. This would not be possible, but business stakeholders have been  known to ask for ambitious additional features, without appreciating the  cost implications. Sometimes a manager asks for information to help with a  decision, which at first seems reasonable but turns out to involve building a  very sophisticated Business Intelligence System (BIS) at a cost far exceeding  the original budget.  yy Removing conflicts: some requirements may contradict or conflict with other  requirements such that only one may be implemented.",705,109,176.25
227,"When such a conflict  is identified, the business analyst is responsible for helping to negotiate a  resolution. Sometimes confirming relevance will resolve a conflict if only one of  the requirements is directly aligned with the business objectives. However, if the  sources of the requirements are adamant, and there is no room for compromise  or discussion, then the decision will need to be passed to the sponsor or  even escalated to the project board. Conflicting requirements sometimes  come from different business perspectives, sometimes from organisational  politics and sometimes from interpersonal tensions. The analyst will often  need to tread carefully to avoid alienating either party.",701,103,175.25
227,"The approach used to  analyse stakeholder perspectives described in Chapter 6 can be very helpful  in understanding any differences of view at an early stage.

For example, a  requirement may dictate that a specific software package should be used rather  than express the business requirements to be satisfied. yy Confirm standard of quality: all requirements should meet the quality criteria  and should be: ß Clear – the requirement must be expressed in clear language, avoiding  vague adjectives and adverbs and using precise verbs and nouns.

228," ß Concise – the requirement must be described concisely. This is not the place  to specify data items, triggers or conditions. They will come further down the  line.

228,"All  requirements must be worded using the same format. This reduces ambiguity  and confusion, and makes validation much more straightforward. ß Relevant – the requirement must be within the scope of the project.

228,"This can arise because of the problems of terminology and jargon,  or may result from poor grammar. Common sources of confusion involve the  use of synonyms (two words used to mean the same thing) and homonyms  (the same word used to mean different things). This is especially relevant  when a project involves more than one department or division. If two people  who read a requirement have a different mental picture of what is being  asked for, then it is ambiguous. It is important that developers and business  users compare their understanding of the requirements to be sure that there  is no misinterpretation.",617,102,154.25
228,Use of a glossary of terms for the project helps to  guard against such misunderstandings.  ß Correct – the requirement statement must describe something that is  actually required to meet the objectives. ß Testable – the requirement should be described such that the solution may be  tested to confirm that the requirement has been met. The statement must be  worded so that a simple yes/no answer to the question ‘Has it been delivered  as intended?’ makes sense.,467,77,116.75
228,"Later, non-functional performance measures, e.g.  response time, transaction time, and security restrictions must be built into  the fuller description in the requirements catalogue. ß Traceable – information about the requirement must enable the traceability  of the requirement.

Requirements that are in conflict, are unrealistic, or are out of alignment with the  business objectives, still need to be recorded in the requirements catalogue in order to  ensure that an audit trail is kept of all requirements raised and any subsequent action  taken.

The group may meet to discuss the requirements document in a formal review  meeting, may have a virtual meeting whereby comments are submitted electronically  via a shared forum, or possibly, individual responses via email may be provided.

However, it is still a valuable review approach and is preferable to no review.  Whichever approach is taken to the review, there are two important roles to be filled:  there should be a chairperson, who is responsible for controlling the review, and a  business analyst, who is responsible for providing information about the requirements  document or possibly presenting it to the review meeting.  A common problem regarding validation is that the stakeholders have been too busy  prior to the meeting to study it and carry out the review. The analyst and project manager  must make it clear that this is a task that has to be performed, and must stress the  impact of not getting the requirements right at this stage.",848,144,212.0

Another problem of requirements validation concerns the size of the document that is  to be reviewed. Where the requirements document is large it is a good idea to review it  in sections.

232,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS The outcome of the review should be an agreement that the entire requirements  document is complete, consistent, conformant and a true reflection of what the business  requires to be delivered.  AGILE APPROACH TO REQUIREMENTS The RE approach described above ensures that the project has understood and  incorporated all business needs and user requirements before the solution is designed  for implementation. It provides an audit trail for the requirements document and is  meant to give all stakeholders confidence in the integrity of the development. The  traceability features allow all changes to the requirements, for whatever reason, to be  incorporated in the document with no loss of quality, and the reasons for those changes  recorded in case of query or conflict further down the line. However, the RE approach can be time-consuming and make demands on resources;  many organisations need to produce new systems in a shorter timespan than this  allows so have adopted an Agile approach to development.",1031,159,257.75
232,"The key differences between defining requirements when using an incremental or  waterfall approach and the Agile philosophy, is in the level and type of documentation  that is produced. If RE is employed in an incremental or waterfall-style project, the aim is  to produce a baselined set of good, complete, relevant well-formed requirements before a  solution is specified and designed; this ensures that the development is driven by business  requirements, and not by the technology. Agile, on the other hand, follows a practice of  evolving the requirements during development so much of the detail is not specified in  advance. However, it is good practice to have a definition of the requirements at a level  that enables the Agile development to commence. This requires a set of requirements to  be selected for development within a defined timebox.",855,135,213.75
232,"Despite the less detailed nature of  the requirements definitions, it is still important to use the RE framework to ensure that  the requirements are clear and meet the quality criteria described earlier. The details  of the requirements evolve during the development process and, if desired, the detailed  definition of the requirements is completed once the development has been completed.  The advantage of this is that it reduces the maintenance overhead of managing a  detailed requirements document while the software is being developed. It also removes  the redundant work that may be involved in specifying requirements early on, only to  see them change, and change again, before implementation. The drawbacks are that  it could lead to scope creep as focusing on individual requirements might lead the  developers to overlook the big picture of the business objectives.",879,135,219.75
232,"Also, unless there is  a strong project structure in place, there is a danger that traceability is compromised,  and in future years, maintainability could present a problem where the documentation  is insufficiently detailed. Agile software developments are best suited to a dynamic  environment where requirements are unclear at the outset, and where there is a short  timescale for initial delivery. Levels of Agile requirements An Agile project will normally begin with an intensive workshop, possibly a hothouse  workshop as described in Chapter 5. The business participants at a hothouse will usually  202",611,92,152.75
233,"ESTABLISHING THE REQUIREMENTS be at a senior level, which should help ensure that the development is aligned with the  business strategy, and the functionality identified will contribute to that strategy rather  than simply being a ‘nice idea’. The outcome of the workshop should be the scope, a set of  high-level requirements, a priority for implementing the requirements and some way of  representing which actors need to interact with the system. While there is no prescribed  format for this output, a commonly used notation is the use case diagram. These diagrams  are illustrated in Chapter 12. Each use case represents a piece of functionality that is  needed to meet an actor’s needs, and may contain a number of requirements to satisfy  them; these requirements need not be defined absolutely until just before they are due to  be built.",847,137,211.75
233,"An alternative approach is to employ the ‘user stories’ technique, which identify the  features required by an actor to be fulfilled by a system. The stories themselves may be at  two levels: ‘epic’ and individual story. ‘ Epic’ describes a story that, because of size, cannot  be implemented in a single development period and so must be broken down into smaller,  lower-level stories. The lower-level user stories are inputs to the development process,  which is carried out in a series of ‘timeboxes’ or ‘sprints’ which typically may last between  15 days and 4 weeks, depending upon the scale of the development. The developer, using  a prototyping approach and technology, sits with the business user and business analyst,  to elaborate on the requirements that will deliver the user story and meet its defined goal.",821,133,205.25
233," The user story will generally be framed to answer the questions, Who? What? Why?  and be expressed in the format: ‘As a {user role} I want {feature} so that I can {reason}.’ ‘ As a warehouse clerk I want to record the quantity of an item that has been picked so  that I can know how much stock is left in the bin.’",315,63,78.75
233,"This format has the following benefits: who – helps us be sure we build a usable product,  as the actor concerned will be with the developer as they construct the prototype;  what – defines the functionality that is being provided; why – identifies rationale for  the function; this may be in terms of enabling a dependent activity or adding value by  the performance of the action. The why feature enables decisions about the priority of  the stories. Once the story has been agreed, it is often documented on an index card  (paper or electronic). Business rules, pre-conditions and constraints are then elicited  and added to the story, so that they can form part of the prototype. There is discussion among Agile proponents as to whether user stories, use cases or  a mixture best represent the requirements.",811,136,202.75
233,"There is not a single correct answer, just  as there is not a single best approach to Agile developments. Each team and each  organisation that uses this approach will have its own standards and preferences. What  is more important is that the process is tightly controlled, so that the successive sprints  are planned and always in accordance with the architecture and the business objectives. It is important to recognise that Agile offers an alternative philosophy rather than a  rigid methodology. It has evolved over several years, beginning with early approaches to  development such as RAD, and in the tradition of systems thinking and Lean.",648,104,162.0
233,"It is likely  to continue evolving as the world and the technology keep advancing. If a system is likely  to have a short life before needing to be replaced, a ‘light touch’ RE approach followed by  Agile software development is an obvious approach to use; if the system is likely to form  the backbone of the company’s operations for a substantial time or is highly complex,  a linear development lifecycle preceded by a more rigorous RE approach would be  beneficial and would make future maintenance and enhancements much less risky. 203",540,91,135.0
234,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS SUMMARY Requirements engineering is the approach by which we ensure that the process of  understanding and documenting the business requirements is rigorous and ensures  the traceability of each requirement. This chapter has considered the RE stages of  elicitation, analysis (which feeds back into the elicitation), and validation; the supporting  stages of documentation and management are considered in Chapter 11. All of these  stages contribute to the production of a rigorous, complete requirements document.  The core of this document is a repository of individual requirements that is developed  and managed and provides the basis for deciding upon business and software changes.  Where organisations place insufficient emphasis on defining requirements it is to the  detriment of the implemented solutions and can leave business stakeholders unable  to do their jobs effectively.",906,130,226.5

235,"11 DOCUMENTING AND MANAGING  REQUIREMENTS Debra Paul INTRODUCTION This chapter is concerned with two of the key elements of requirements engineering –  documenting the requirements that have been gathered and managing those  requirements in such a way that they can be traced through the business change  process, from source to delivery. Documenting requirements clearly is vital for the  success of a project. Many projects have failed because of they have lacked well-formed  definitions of the requirements.  THE IMPORTANCE OF DOCUMENTATION There are many reasons for needing good documentation. First, it enables communi­ cation within the project team and provides a basis for ensuring that all of the related  requirements are consistent with each other.",761,114,190.25
235,"Second, the documentation provides the  business managers and staff, who are the sources and owners of the requirements, with  a firm basis for validating that the documentation accurately records what they need the  solution to provide. Third, any further work to develop and test the business solutions  will use the documentation as input to these activities. The requirements documentation  will define what the solution is to do and the acceptance criteria required to test that the  required features have been delivered correctly. The requirements documentation is also  used following the implementation of the solution. For example, in the maintenance of IT  systems and during benefits realisation.",708,106,177.0
235, THE REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT Structure The requirements document has to provide the basis for the solutions to be delivered  to the organisation so it needs to be well formed and clear. The business managers  and staff have to review the documentation in order to ensure that the descriptions of  the requirements reflect their needs and that the analysts have correctly interpreted  and understood the information provided to them. One of the key tactics to support the  review of the documentation is to ensure that it is organised and well structured.  The requirements document needs to provide all of the information that the reviewers  require in an easily understandable and digestible form. A well-structured document  will help to improve the accessibility of the document and enable reviewers to identify  205,817,128,204.25
236,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS errors and omissions. The requirements document may be partitioned by requirement  type, business area or, at a more detailed level, for specific groups of stakeholders.  Whatever the basis used for partitioning, an organised requirements document  will make reviewing much easier and help to ensure that the agreed requirements  are accurate. Content of the requirements document The requirements document will usually contain the sections represented in Figure 11.1. Figure 11.1  Contents of a requirements document Figure 11.1 yy Introduction and background.",579,82,144.75
236,"This section should set out a description of the  business situation and drivers for the project. It serves to clarify the objectives  and scope of the work and ensure that all stakeholders are aware of the  business context for the requirements.  yy Business process models. Typically, business requirements involve changes  to the business processes and any new or enhanced software solution must  support the business process changes. In this section the ‘to be’ process models  should set out the vision for the new processes and may be accompanied by  more detailed task models.",583,93,145.75
236,The ‘as is’ processes that are to be revised may also  be included here if required for additional clarity or explanation. yy Function models. Diagrams showing the functionality of the proposed software  solution may be included here. Typical diagrams used here are context diagrams  and use case diagrams. These diagrams provide an excellent overview of the  solution and provide a means for structuring the requirements catalogue.,432,66,108.0
236," Context diagrams and use case diagrams are described in Chapter 12. yy Data model. A data model is highly relevant where the requirements require a  detailed level of data definition, for example, if it is intended to build a software  solution or evaluate an off-the-shelf software package. However, it is also  useful to develop a data model to understand the nature of the data and the  business rules that apply to the relationships between data groups. If the  requirements catalogue contains lists of data within individual requirements,  these lists are extremely difficult to review and evaluate for correctness.",621,98,155.25
236,"Also,  the structure of the data, and how the different groups of data need to relate  to each other, cannot be defined easily within a textual description. A data  206",168,30,42.0
237,"DOCUMENTING AND MANAGING REQUIREMENTS 	 model provides a far superior view of the data than textual descriptions and  enables the analyst to consider the exact business rules and requirements to  be met by the solution. It is also a parsimonious view that enables the analyst  to ask searching questions. Two data modelling techniques, entity relationship  modelling and class modelling, are described in Chapter 12. yy Requirements catalogue. The information about each individual requirement  should be documented in the requirements catalogue.",546,79,136.5
237,"The catalogue is the key  component for the audit trail of the requirements as it is the central repository  of information relating to the identification, cross referencing and source of the  requirements. This document is described in more detail below. yy Glossary of terms. One of the key quality characteristics for the requirements  document is to ensure that it provides a clear definition of the requirements so that  it can be read, understood and agreed as easily as possible. However, within any  organisation there will be terminology that is understood by the people working in a  particular area and often this terminology is very precise in conveying information.",678,108,169.5
237," As a result, while it is important that the requirements use this terminology, this  can present a problem for the analysts and reviewers who lack familiarity with the  terms. A glossary of terms overcomes this problem and provides a central source  of terminology definitions. The glossary may be created just for a particular project  or there may be an organisation-wide glossary that can be used as a basis. Either  way, it is an important component of the requirements document and will be used  throughout the business change and software development lifecycles. This is not an exhaustive list and many organisations include other areas in their  templates.",664,106,166.0
237,"For example, a list of assumptions or decisions made can often be found in  a requirements document. THE REQUIREMENTS CATALOGUE When requirements are initially elicited, they are not organised and it is only once  the requirements analysis activity takes place that they are structured and formed  into an organised set. There are a number of ways of organising requirements but  fundamentally, a hierarchical approach will provide the easiest structure for navigating  and reviewing the requirements. Figure 11.2 shows the four types of requirements:  general, technical, functional and non-functional. These categories provide a useful  overview structure for a requirements catalogue.",687,99,171.75
237,Figure 11.2  Types of requirements Figure 1 1.2 207,51,9,12.75
238,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS This hierarchy structures the requirements into four discrete areas, based upon the  type of requirements. These are described below. At the next level, the hierarchy uses  other subdivisions to categorise the requirements. For example, within the functional  requirements, all of the requirements relating to reporting may be grouped together or  each use case may be used as a mechanism to group requirements. Types of requirements Within each of these areas there are several specific categories of requirement that  should be considered in further detail.",577,86,144.25
238,"We can use these categories as aides-memoire  to ensure that areas of requirement are not missed. As discussed in Chapter 10,  tacit knowledge is a major issue when eliciting requirements and the categories of  requirement provide a useful basis for asking specific questions about areas that the  business staff may not consider relevant or are taken for granted. Figure 11.3 shows  the key categories of requirement for each type identified above.  Figure 11.3  Categories of requirements Figure  11.3 General requirements These are the requirements that define business policies, standards and needs.  These requirements are often very broad in scope and can have an impact upon a  number of different areas.",711,110,177.75
238,"Many general requirements apply to entire business change  programmes, sometimes all of the change initiatives underway across the organisation.  There are specific sub-categories of general requirement: 208",207,27,51.75
239,"DOCUMENTING AND MANAGING REQUIREMENTS yy Business constraints – these cover aspects such as budget, timescale and  resources. yy Business policies – these cover aspects such as standards and business policy  decisions (often known as business rules). These policies and standards ensure  consistency of operation across the organisation and are often linked to the  vision and values of the organisation. Business policies may define specific  areas such as the environmental policy or the strategy to be adopted to ensure  business continuity. yy Legal – these are the requirements that state relevant legal and regulatory  constraints.",637,94,159.25
239,"These requirements may relate to organisations in many business  sectors, for example the Data Protection Act applies to any organisation that  holds personal data, or may be specific to a business sector or industry, for  example, the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 and Basel III Accord which apply in  the financial sector.  yy Branding – these requirements are concerned with the image and style to be  promoted for the organisation. Typically, there will be branding documentation,  for example a style guide, which will set out factors such as logos, key words,  language and colour requirements. This documentation will ensure a consistent  brand and image are established across all forms of communication deployed  by the organisation. The style guide will set out the ‘look and feel’ of any systems  and documents used within the course of the organisation’s work.",869,137,217.25
239,"yy Cultural – these requirements relate to the type of culture required within  the organisation. This may mean that the requirements set out the vision  for the organisation, the approach taken to dealing with customers and the  management style. yy Language – many organisations have specific language requirements as  they are operating across international boundaries and languages. These  requirements set out the languages to be used in the organisation and the ways  of communicating with customers and other organisations. Technical requirements These are the requirements that state the technical policies and constraints to  be adopted across the organisation and apply to a range of change projects.",710,106,177.5
239,"These  requirements may refer to the artefacts that describe the technical infrastructure for  the organisation. The specific sub-categories of technical requirements are: yy Hardware requirements covering aspects such as the make and model of  hardware equipment to be used in the organisation. The requirements may  cover the IT hardware but can also include equipment relating to the work of  the organisation such as production or general office equipment. yy Software requirements covering areas such as operating systems, software  applications, networking and communications software. There may also be  standards for use of online software such as cloud computing services.",681,98,170.25

The interfaces may be with systems and  equipment operated within the organisation or by other, external organisations. yy Internet requirements. These requirements relate to the technical policies  governing the organisation’s use of the internet and web-enabled services. Functional requirements The functional requirements set out the features that any solution should provide.",438,58,109.5
240,"The  features set out in these requirements may be provided by an IT system solution but  this is not necessarily the case. Some of the requirements may prove to be too costly  or time-consuming if provided by IT, in which case alternative means of delivering them  will need to be considered – or they could be dropped altogether. Some requirements  may be better delivered by non-IT means, for example, a personal communication may  be more effective.  The functional requirements form a key element of the requirements catalogue  because they define the specific features to be delivered by a solution. Also, whereas  the general and technical requirements tend to have a certain longevity, the functional  requirements can be subject to frequent change, particularly as they are elaborated  to a more detailed level.",820,131,205.0
240,"The level of detail used to define the functional requirements,  and when this detail is completed, will depend partly upon the delivery mechanism  adopted. For example, if a linear software development approach is required, the  requirements will need to be defined in sufficient detail for the design and development  of the IT system to be undertaken. Alternatively, if an iterative development approach  is to be adopted, the detailed requirements may evolve during the development activity  and the documentation updated at a later stage. However, sometimes, the level of  the requirements documentation to be produced is not this clear cut. For example, in  situations where the development is outsourced, an iterative approach may be taken  but the requirements will need to be defined to a sufficient level to help manage any  communication difficulties.",862,132,215.5
240,"Also, it may be the case that while some of the requirements  may evolve during the iterative development, there may be a part of the system that  requires the application of complex business rules; in this case, it would be very sensible  to define these clearly up front. If the requirements are to be managed closely, certain characteristics – such as the  identifier and source – need to be documented so that each requirement can be tracked  through the development and delivery of the business solution. When eliciting and  investigating functional requirements, it can be useful to consider several categories: yy Data entry requirements are concerned with gathering and recording the data  that is required in the solution. yy Data maintenance requirements handle changes to the data used within the  solution. yy Procedure requirements.",845,134,211.25
240,One of the key sources of error in a business solution  is where the detailed business rules to be applied during the working procedures  are not understood well. These requirements need to be defined clearly so that  they can be adopted accurately within the solution. Techniques such as decision  trees or decision tables can be very useful in documenting these requirements. 210,381,62,95.25
241,"DOCUMENTING AND MANAGING REQUIREMENTS yy Retrieval requirements. These requirements are concerned with requests  about the data and include the provision of specified reports and responses  to enquiries. Management and operational information requirements can  be numerous and wide-ranging. In this case, it can be useful to consider  these requirements as a separate area of functionality when structuring the  requirements catalogue. Non-functional requirements The non-functional requirements are concerned with how well the solution will operate  and answers questions such as: ‘how quickly will it respond?’",612,83,153.0
241,"and ‘how easy will it be to  use?’ There are several areas of non-functional requirement to consider: yy Speed of performance. These requirements concern the speed with which a  transaction should be processed. For example, if a customer wishes to order  some goods or place a booking, this requirement would define the speed of the  processing to handle this. yy Level of security.",382,63,95.5
241,The majority of organisations handle information and data  of varying levels of confidentiality. These requirements identify the security  levels required for the organisation’s data. The security levels are likely to differ  depending upon the nature of the data. Some will be highly confidential and  require extremely rigorous security while other data may still be confidential  but subject to less security. The storage requirements for the data may also be  defined here.,477,71,119.25
241," yy Access permissions and constraints. These requirements are usually related  to the security requirements as they define the stakeholder groups and  their levels of access to the data. The access permissions will state which  stakeholders are able to carry out which transactions. For example, which  stakeholders are allowed to delete the details held for a customer or pay an  invoice from a supplier. The requirements relating to the provision of functions  to implement the access permissions will be documented within the functional  requirements.",555,83,138.75
241,"yy Backup and recovery. The requirements for secure storage and access of  information are also linked to these requirements. While it is important to  guard against confidentiality breaches, retaining data is also vital, particularly  with the rise of remote storage and cloud computing.

241,"The retention of data and information retained within  an organisation may be subject to internal policies or external legal regulations.

For  example, there may be requirements which state how quickly an organisation  should be operational, possibly in a limited form, following a business continuity  incident. Business continuity requirements may include those to prevent  a disaster affecting the organisation to any great extent – for example, the  need for duplicate installations – and also contingency requirements should  a disaster occur. There are likely to be several non-functional requirements  related to the business continuity requirements, for example, in the area of  backup and recovery. yy Availability.",678,95,169.5
242,"The timeframe during which a solution must be available to  stakeholders. For many web-enabled systems, this is likely to be 24/7 (24 hours  a day, 7 days a week) availability. However, other solutions may not require  this level of availability or there may be some aspects that can accept a lesser  level of availability.

242,"This area concerns the ease with which a stakeholder can learn, apply  and use new processes and systems. It is a critical aspect of many IT solutions  in particular because of web-enabled information and purchasing services  offered by many organisations. Whereas internal business stakeholders can be  trained to use new processes and systems, this will not be possible for external  stakeholders such as customers so ease of learning and use is very important.  There are many aspects that can be defined for usability requirements including  speed of learning to use the system and ease of navigation (for example, the  number of clicks to obtain information).  yy Accessibility.",683,107,170.75
242,"The accessibility requirements are related to the usability  requirements but they focus specifically on enabling access for all, regardless  of infirmity or disability. We need to consider four aspects: ß cognitive disability; ß motor disability; ß hearing disability; ß visual disability. 	 These requirements state the need for features that enable accessibility for  anyone with a disability. The means of meeting accessibility requirements can  be numerous and varied. For example, providing software facilities such as such  as screen reading tools and using images rather than text, or physical facilities  such as access ramps and lifts, or considering the height and positioning of  buttons (such as those in lifts) and counters.",742,109,185.5
242," yy Capacity. These requirements cover areas such as the volumes of data or  images to be stored, the volumes of transactions to be processed and the  number of stakeholders to be supported. The non-functional requirements are areas that are often left until later or even  dismissed at an overview level without clear thought and analysis. This can be a critical  error. There are numerous apocryphal tales of organisational disasters – or near  212",450,73,112.5

Public sector organisations have been  criticised heavily for losing confidential data, or making it accessible when this should  not be the case. However, private sector organisations are not necessarily any better at  this.

How often have you left an organisation’s  website in frustration at the lack of assistance and the time required to complete a  simple enquiry? And accessibility for all is growing in importance with the increasing  recognition of the need to ensure anyone with a disability has the access they need.  Business analysts have a range of techniques at their disposal (see Chapter 5) to enable  them to explore non-functional requirements and ensure that they are identified at an  early stage rather than being considered as a later (and often more expensive) addition.  In a competitive business world, organisations cannot afford such legal transgressions  and business mistakes.",831,135,207.75
243,"It is often the work of the business analyst that analyses the  needs and ensures the solution includes the processes and systems to overcome them. Hierarchy of requirements Requirements are related to each other. Some of the general and technical requirements  are elaborated and expanded in the non-functional and functional requirements;  some functional requirements are related to non-functional requirements. All of  the requirements are driven by the organisation’s values, strategy and objectives. If  a requirement is not aligned with these then it needs to be explored further as it is  questionable that it is really a requirement.",642,97,160.5
243,"Understanding the hierarchy of requirements  helps ensure that the requirements are consistent and coherent. When we define a  functional requirement the business context provides the basis that underpins and  supports the requirement. When eliciting non-functional requirements, the business  and technical policies help give insights into why these requirements are necessary at  the level of performance stated.  For example, data protection legislation defines the principles to be adopted by any  organisation that stores personal data. This requirement will be elaborated further in  the non-functional requirements to define the security levels required for specific sets  of data, and the requirements concerning access restrictions, backup and recovery.",762,104,190.5
243," Further, the functional requirements that define the data requirements will be linked to  the security and legal requirements for this area. The hierarchy of requirements, linking functional and non-functional requirements  back to the general and technical business requirements, provides a means of tracing  the original business need for the requirements. This helps when considering the  priority of the requirements, the timescale for delivery and the possibility of removing  a requirement.

Requirement	 The unique identifier allocated to the requirement. This is often  identifier	 a code that is linked to the type of requirement. For example,  the technical requirements may be allocated the identifier  T-n such as T-001, T-002, etc.",524,76,131.0
244,"The identifier may also include  a version number, including a draft version number for when  the requirement is still to be reviewed and agreed. An identifier  may be: 	 	 G-006v0-1 to indicate a general requirement in its first draft  version; 	 	 F-028v2-0 to indicate a functional requirement in its second  reviewed and agreed version. Alternatively, the version history  for the requirement may include the version number (see  below). Requirement name	 The name allocated to a requirement. This is a short descriptive  phrase that indicates what the requirement concerns.",581,86,145.25
244,"Requirement	 The description should provide a clear definition of the  description	 requirement. Initially, the description may be at an outline level  and elaborated in more detailed versions of the requirement  documentation. When describing requirements it is good  practice to adopt the following structure: yy actor (or user role) yy verb phrase yy object (noun or noun phrase). 	 	 An example functional requirement is: ‘the receptionist shall be  able to view the customer name, address and telephone number’. 	 	 An example general requirement is: ‘the solution shall comply  with the provisions of the Data Protection Act’.",635,93,158.75
244,"Source		 The originating person or information source for the require- ment. This may be a stakeholder or could be a document  containing information relevant to the project. For example,  a stakeholder may have identified the requirement during  an interview or other discussion, or there may be an earlier  document – such as a project brief or feasibility study – that  includes some of the business requirements.

It may be sufficient  to indicate whether the requirement is general, technical,  functional or non-functional – although it may not be necessary  to state this if the identifier includes a reference to the type.  The type of requirement may be defined at sub-category level,  for example, a requirement may be general, legal.",624,92,156.0
245,"Priority		 The level of priority of the requirement. The approach used  here varies between organisations but can also vary between  different projects within an organisation. Sometimes a  straightforward approach of high, medium or low priority  is used with the organisation deciding the implications of  each level. Similarly, sometimes the categories ‘mandatory’,  ‘desirable’ and ‘nice to have’ are used. The Dynamic Systems  Development Method (DSDM) defined a richer approach to  prioritisation using the mnemonic MoSCoW. This approach  is particularly suitable where several increments of a  business change solution are to be implemented or iterative  development is to be used to develop a software solution.",719,103,179.75
245,The  MoSCoW mnemonic stands for: 	 	 M – Must have. Mandatory in the first increment. Absolutely  essential. 	 	 S – Should have. Mandatory but may be deferred (for a short  period) to the second increment.,208,33,52.0
245,	 	 C – Could have. Desirable but may not be implemented due to  time and budget. 	 	 W – Want to have but won’t have this time. Identified as a  requirement to be deferred until a later stage. There may  be several reasons why a requirement is deferred.,256,46,64.0
245,Some  requirements are recognised as needing further consideration  and would cause delays to some of the mandatory requirements  if they were to be implemented in the first increment. Other  requirements may require a later implementation for business  reasons. This may be because it concerns an element of the  business strategy that is due to be put into operation at a later  point or could be an anticipated legal change.

Related requirements	 The identifiers of any requirements that are related to this  requirement. They may be related for several reasons:  there is a higher-level business requirement that provides  further business information or justification for a functional  or non-functional requirement; there are non-functional  requirements concerning areas such as usability or security  that affect functional requirements or vice versa; there are  other requirements that concern a similar general, technical,  functional or non-functional area.",855,118,213.75

These documents may be  project documentation such as the project initiation document  or may be business justification documents such as the  business case. Another form of documentation that may be  linked to the requirements is the modelling documents that  have been created for the business change project. Some  of these models may be contained within the requirements  document however, it is still useful to show where there are  requirements that are related to them.",665,100,166.25

247,"Each version should  also record the reason for the change to the requirement and  the reference to the change control documentation. However, producing a full definition for each requirement will be extremely time- consuming and could be wasted effort in some situations. The level of detail of the  definition will depend upon several factors: yy The stage of the analysis, is it an initial view of the requirements or a more  detailed requirements specification? yy The nature of the solution, for example, a business process change or IT system  replacement. yy The level of priority of each requirement.",608,98,152.0

247,"It records what is required, the business justifications, sources of information  and a rich network of connections. The level of the descriptions needs to be sufficient for  the purpose rather than over-engineered for any eventuality. Sometimes the business  stakeholders are unable to provide the precise requirements in extensive detail and  the approach that will deliver the requirements needs to take account of this. In this  situation, the description still needs to be clear about what is required but may not  contain the complete set of details; a useful distinction is to separate what is required  from how it will be delivered. Sometimes, the business staff have decided what is  217",697,110,174.25
248,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS needed but some of the finer detail concerning how the requirement will ultimately be  delivered may still be open for discussion. In this situation, the requirements catalogue  should be clear about what is required and leave the further detail to be explored using  approaches such as scenarios and prototyping. MANAGING REQUIREMENTS A failure to understand, document and manage requirements often lies at the heart of  problems with business and IT system changes projects. While a structured, well defined  set of requirements will provide an excellent basis for a change project, problems can  still occur if the requirements are not traceable. The traceability of the requirements is a  critical quality characteristic.",743,112,185.75
248,There are two forms of traceability: horizontal and vertical. Horizontal traceability concerns tracing the requirement from inception to delivery. We  can think about ‘backwards from’ and ‘forwards to’ horizontal traceability: yy ‘Backwards from’ traceability involves the ability to trace the source of a  requirement from any later point in the business change or software development  lifecycle. It answers the question ‘what was the source requirement for this  feature of the solution and who raised it?’ We need to be able to identify where a  requirement originated so that we can seek clarification from the source where  necessary.,640,97,160.0
248,"This is particularly important when requirements are in conflict or  there are conflicting views as to the priority of a requirement. yy ‘Forwards to’ traceability involves the ability to identify any requirement and  track where it has been further developed and ultimately implemented. It  answers the question ‘what happened to this requirement?’ and should show  that each requirement has been resolved satisfactorily. Vertical traceability concerns tracing a requirement up or down the hierarchy so  answers the questions about alignment with business values, strategy and objectives.",589,85,147.25
248,Requirements management is essential if there is to be traceability of requirements.  There are several elements involved in managing requirements as shown in Figure 11.4  and described below. Figure 11.4  Elements of requirements management Figure 11.4 218,257,37,64.25
249,"DOCUMENTING AND MANAGING REQUIREMENTS Requirements identification  Each requirement needs to be identified uniquely in order that any reference to that  requirement corresponds to only one requirement. Cross-referencing  All related requirements and documents should be cross-referenced so that further  elaboration or information concerning the requirement can be accessed easily. During  requirements management, the cross-references provide the basis for the impact  analysis of proposed changes. They allow the analyst to identify which requirements  are related to the requirement that is the subject of the change, and consider whether  the change will affect the other requirements. Origin and ownership The source identifies the origin of the requirement.",763,104,190.75
249,"This is the person or document  the requirement should be traced back to during ‘backwards from’ traceability. This  is the origin of the requirement and, whether this was a person or a document, will be  able to provide additional information and justification about the requirement. When  considering changes to the requirement, the source can help to clarify the impact of the  change and as a result help with the decision about the change.  The owner typically has responsibility for the business area affected by the requirement  and will need to make decisions about the requirement. It is important therefore that this  person is involved as the change project unfolds.",677,109,169.25
249,"The owner will be a key stakeholder  should any proposed changes arise that will affect the requirement, either directly or  indirectly via related requirements. In addition, fundamental business changes such as  budget reductions or timescale changes may require requirements to be discontinued,  reprioritised or delayed; the owner will be the senior person in the decision-making  process for the requirement and will have the ultimate authority concerning the  requirement. Configuration management Configuration management is concerned with controlling any changes made to project  deliverables, such as documents, in order to ensure that the changes are made  in a disciplined manner and traceability sustained. Without effective configuration  management the requirements document can become inaccurate as the following  problems can occur: yy inability or difficulty in identifying the latest version of a requirement; yy the reintroduction of out-of-date requirements; yy using the wrong set of requirements for further development or testing work. As a result, it is important that appropriate mechanisms are developed that will manage  the implementation of any changes to the requirements.",1201,170,300.25
249,There are two key areas to  consider: 219,41,8,10.25
250,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS yy configuration identification; yy configuration control. Configuration identification Configuration identification is concerned with defining the following: yy The deliverables to be brought under configuration control. These are known as  the configuration items (CIs). During requirements management, the deliverables  will include the individual requirements catalogue entries, the composite set of  entries that form the requirements catalogue, the models that elaborate and  define the requirements, the requirements document. There should also be a  structure showing how these configuration items relate to each other.",645,83,161.25
250,"yy The identifier and version numbering scheme to be applied to the CIs. As  discussed previously, each requirement has a unique identifier but if we are  to control the other configuration items then this will also be required for each  of them. For example, the requirements catalogue will require an identifier.  Where a CI has been identified, and has an identifier, it will also require a version  number. The approach to be adopted for allocating version numbers will need  to be defined.",494,82,123.5
250,"Version numbers will apply to each individual CI. For example,  while a requirement will have a version number, so will the whole requirements  catalogue within which the requirement sits. Configuration control There will also need to be a process for controlling the CIs and ensuring that they are  not changed without formal approval and version numbering. This is typically called a  version control process. There are several elements to this: First, a CI is created in draft form.",485,78,121.25
250,"While the item will have an identifier, the version  number will need to indicate that the CI is in draft form. One approach is to number  initial drafts using the format 0.n. For example, a draft requirement catalogue entry with  an identifier T-007 could be numbered T-007v0.3 indicating that this is the third draft  version of the technical requirement numbered 007. Second, as described in Chapter 10, requirements validation is carried out to review and  agree the requirements documentation. At this point, the CIs that describe the requirements  are said to be ‘baselined’.",581,93,145.25
250,"This means that they are brought under configuration control and  cannot be changed by anyone without the following the formal configuration management  procedure. When a CI is brought under configuration control it is allocated a version number  reflecting its baselined status. Using our example above, the technical requirement would  have the identifier/version number T-007v1.0. Sometimes it can be useful to baseline a  requirements document prior to requirements validation, when rigorous requirements  analysis has been carried out and a formal approach to change control is felt to be beneficial.  Third, once a CI is baselined, no changes can be made to the content without the  approval of the configuration manager.",727,109,181.75
250,"All of the CIs should be stored in a secure area  so that they cannot be accessed and revised at will. If a change to an item is approved,  the configuration manager releases it for revision. Once the item has been amended and  the revised version brought under configuration control, the new version is renumbered.  In our example, the requirement would now be allocated T-007v2.0. 220",386,66,96.5
251,"DOCUMENTING AND MANAGING REQUIREMENTS Configuration management in an Agile environment Configuration management needs particular consideration when an Agile development  approach such as DSDM or Scrum is used. Because these approaches tend to embrace  change and explore requirements using prototyping approaches, initially much of the  information about the requirements will be defined within the prototypes rather than  the requirements documentation. While the high-level requirements documentation should be relatively stable, the  prototypes that are used to elaborate and implement the requirements are likely to  change regularly. Having baselined the requirements document reasonably early in  the development project, this document will provide an audit trail for the high-level  requirements. Further detail regarding the requirements may be added at a later stage.",876,118,219.0
251," Baselining and controlling the versions of the prototypes will also be important if the  requirements are to be managed.  There are several possibilities for baselining the prototypes during Agile software  development including: yy Baselining every prototype before demonstration: this has the virtue of  clarifying the version that has been demonstrated to the business users. yy Baselining daily: this is highly disciplined but can prove onerous and  unnecessary. yy Baselining at the end of a timebox: this is fine if the timeboxes are reasonably  short – a few days perhaps – but less sensible with longer timeboxes or, for  example, the 21-day ‘sprints’ used within Scrum. Each baselined prototype is placed under configuration control as this is the only way  to ensure that the up-to-date version of the prototype is used.",831,130,207.75
251,"The CI will consist of the  actual prototype, the tests run on it and the record of the users’ comments. Thus, as  the prototypes are developed and refined, a complete audit trail is created of the changes  made and – very importantly – why they were made. Change control  Changes occur frequently on projects. This may be because of external factors such as  legal or regulatory changes or competitive forces, or may result from internal changes,  such as strategies, policies or people. As a result, any requirement may be subject to  change during a project.",561,95,140.25
251,"Having accepted that changes will happen, then requirements  management should include a process to handle these changes. The stages of this  process are as follows: yy Documenting the proposed change. The change should be documented as a  ‘change request’, stating who raised the change, a description of the change and  a justification for requesting it. yy Consulting the stakeholders. Each change request should be sent to  representative stakeholders to assess the impact of the proposed change,  including the effort to make the change and the corresponding cost.",569,87,142.25
251,221,3,1,0.75
252,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS yy Deciding on the change. The change request and the impact assessment should  be reviewed by the designated approval authority. If the change is approved  for implementation, the CI is released by the configuration librarian so that the  change can be applied and the new version created. The combination of the  configuration management and change control approaches provide a means  of creating a version history for the requirements documentation. Each change  that has been applied to the requirements is documented and explains why one  version was changed to create the new version.",608,94,152.0
252,"Over time, a complete audit trail  will be created explaining what actions were taken, why this was done and when. Software support  Most requirements documents contain too many requirements to manage the set of  documentation, cross-references and versions manually so an automated tool is usually  required. These tools should provide the following features: yy Documentation creation and storage. This will require editing tools that  provide facilities such as word processing and modelling. Further, some tools  provide document management capability that incorporates functions such  as publishing documentation for access by authorised stakeholders, allowing  on-line reviewing and tracking revisions.",708,97,177.0
252,"yy Secure storage and access. If the documentation is to be placed under  configuration control, it will be essential for there to be restricted access to the  individual documents. yy Documentation linkage.

252,Such software can offer  the key functionality required for requirements management but will also require a  great deal of manual activity to supplement the automated support. SUMMARY Well defined and traceable requirements are undeniably key to a successful business  change project. They set out what a solution needs to deliver and the relative priorities  of the features to be included. The requirements document needs to be structured  clearly so that a thorough requirements validation can be conducted by the reviewers.  Traceability of the requirements is also critical if the business is to be able to confirm  that their needs have been met and all decisions regarding the requirements are to  be transparent and auditable.,734,114,183.5

254,"12 MODELLING REQUIREMENTS Debra Paul and James Cadle INTRODUCTION This chapter introduces some of the most commonly used techniques for modelling  requirements for IT systems. These techniques are used to analyse and specify  requirements during systems development. Models are extremely useful in helping  to clarify understanding and, if cross-checked with other models, ensuring the  completeness of the analysis. A model shows only one view, or perspective, of a  system but shows this view very clearly. This induces the analyst to ask further  questions, often those that have not been identified previously.",614,91,153.5
254,"The techniques  we describe here have been selected from two distinct approaches to systems  modelling: use case diagrams and class modelling from the Unified Modeling  Language (UML), and entity relationship modelling from the family of structured,  data-driven approaches. The selected techniques model two distinct views of the IT  system: the functions that the system will provide and the data to be stored within  the system. MODELLING BUSINESS USE CASES A top-level view of an organisation or business system can be provided through  developing a business use case diagram. Use cases are described in more detail  in the next section but, for now, it is sufficient to say that they represent things  that an organisation, business system or IT system need to provide. A business  use case diagram shows the usage that stakeholders require of a system.",858,136,214.5
254,"An  example is shown in Figure 12.1; there are just two actors, a project manager and a  programme manager, and the use cases represent what they require of the business  system.  Business use case diagrams can be extremely useful when scoping a project or gaining  an overview of the areas to be investigated and analysed. Some of the use cases on a  business use case diagram may be fulfilled by an IT system but for others this may be  only partially the case, and for some the solution may be completely manual. Some  of the business use cases shown in Figure 12.1 are taken down to the system level in  Figures 12.2 to 12.4. 224",633,115,158.25
255,"MODELLING REQUIREMENTS Figure 12.1  Use case diagram for a project management organisation Figure 12.1 MODELLING SYSTEM USE CASES The saying ‘one picture is worth ten thousand words’ applies directly to the definition  of IT system requirements. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to write textual  statements that are completely unambiguous. However, this is not the case with  a model that has been drawn using defined notational standards; each box and line  makes a clear statement about the system under investigation. Some models are more  easily understood by business users than others. The view of a system that is often  most accessible to business users depicts the ‘functions’ that will be provided and the  ‘actors’ who are involved in using those functions.",782,122,195.5
255,"A function may be defined as a set  of actions that the business users want the IT system to support in order to achieve a  specific goal. For example, a function might be ‘Record customer’ and the actions here  would include the following: yy accept the customer details; yy validate the customer details; yy store the customer details that have been entered. In the Unified Modeling Language (UML), a use case is something that an actor wants the  IT system to do; it is a ‘case of use’ of the system by a specific actor and describes  the interaction between an actor and the system. Each use case will have a stated goal  and will contain a description of the actions that the system must perform to achieve  this goal. The use case model will consist of a diagram showing the actors, the use  cases and the associations between them, plus a set of use case descriptions.",875,157,218.75
255,The  following elements are found in the use case diagram: 225,62,11,15.5
256,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Actors are whoever or whatever expects a service from the system. They are usually  user roles but also may be external systems or time. On the use case diagram, actors  are shown interacting with the use cases. As they are external to the system and outside  its control, defining the system actors and the use cases they are associated with, helps  define the system boundary. Actors are usually shown as matchstick figures, but if the  actor is another system it can be shown by a rectangle with an <<actor>> stereotype  before the name of the system.",572,98,143.0
256,"Some analysts prefer to show all actors, including  the job roles, as rectangles because business users can feel that matchstick figures  trivialise the diagrams. Time can also be an actor and may be shown as a rectangle or  matchstick figure.  Each use case is shown as an oval and represents a function that the system will  perform in response to a trigger from the actor. We use the ‘verb noun’ convention to  name use cases. For example, ‘Set up project’ or ‘Book room’.",475,83,118.75
256,The system boundary is indicated by drawing a large box around all of the use cases  but with the actors outside the box. This clearly illustrates the boundary of the system  and is very useful when agreeing the scope of the system. Associations indicate which actors will need to interact with which use cases. Lines are  drawn linking actors with the appropriate use cases.  The use case diagram in Figure 12.2 shows part of the project control system.,454,78,113.5
256,You might  create a diagram such as this during a workshop or following some interviews with the  business users.  Figure 12.2  System use case diagram for a project control system Figure 12.2 226,196,33,49.0
257,"MODELLING REQUIREMENTS Use case diagrams are particularly useful during a workshop because they are so easily  understood by business users and provide an excellent framework for the discussion.  The detail of the interaction between an actor and a use case is documented in a use  case description. This lists the steps that take place during the interaction and is usually  a textual description. The detail of any processing carried out within the use case may be  documented using a variety of techniques. For example, we could use activity diagrams  from the UML or other more established techniques such as decision tables.",629,101,157.25
257," The <<include>> and <<extend>> constructs When exploring the use cases, it often emerges that some processing elements are  repeated. For example, in the project control system, many of the use cases start by  identifying the project concerned. As it stands, the steps involved in identifying the  project would have to be included in each use case and a great deal of duplication would  result. Instead of this, the project identification elements can be written as a separate  use case and then ‘included’ in a number of others. This is represented in Figure 12.3  where the <<include>> stereotype is shown on a dotted line with an arrowhead pointing  to the included use case.",680,112,170.0
257," Figure 12.3  Use case diagram showing <<include>> Figure 12.3 It may also emerge during more detailed investigation and specification that there are  some elements of the use cases that are not mandatory for the current development  iteration or release of software (in other words, the relevant requirement has not been  classified as a ‘must’ in MoSCoW terms as described in Chapter 11). In this situation, a  separate use case can be created to ‘extend’ the original use case. For example, after the  project manager tracks progress, she may also print a progress report and, in Figure 12.4,  this has been split off into a separate use case because it is not required in the first  227",690,116,172.5

258," MODELLING SYSTEM DATA  It is essential to model the data to be stored within the IT system. A data model allows  the stakeholders who use the system, or obtain information from it, to agree the data  that will be recorded and retrieved. It also provides the basis for the database design in  a bespoke development or helps in the evaluation of a packaged application. But data  modelling should not just be the province of system developers or IT professionals; it is  a key tool for the business analyst. It helps the analyst understand the business rules  that govern the creation, manipulation and deletion of data within an organisation and  the data required to support process improvements.",697,116,174.25
258,It also provides a mechanism for  communicating the data requirements forward into the design and build of an IT system.  The long-established technique of entity relationship modelling is used extensively to  model data and the UML class modelling technique is also widely used. In this chapter  we look at both of these approaches.  228,338,54,84.5
259,"MODELLING REQUIREMENTS ENTITY RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAMS Whether they are computerised or not, organisations require clear and accurate  knowledge of the data structures that underlie their information requirements. Data is  the raw building block of all information systems and the objective of data modelling  is to express this structure in a concise and usable way. Data modelling is concerned  with identifying and understanding: yy the data items (attributes) which the organisation (or system) needs to keep; yy the grouping of the attributes (into entities); yy the relationships between entities. The notation used here for entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) is that developed  by Harry Ellis and Richard Barker and is also known as the CACI notation (after the  consulting firm where they worked at the time). This notation was also adopted for  the Oracle CASE tool and within SSADM (the Structured Systems Analysis and Design  Method) from its version 4 onwards.",970,148,242.5
259,"An entity is something that the enterprise recognises in the area under investigation and  wishes to collect and store data about. An entity might be: yy Physical – for example, an Order, Customer or Supplier. yy Conceptual – for example, a Booking or an Appointment. yy Active – for example, a Meeting or a Course. Entities are represented on the model by a box.",363,64,90.75
259,"Each entity has a meaningful name,  normally a noun, which is always singular. It is important to distinguish between what  are called the ‘entity type’ and the ‘entity occurrence’. For example, if the entity type  is Book then the entity occurrence is a specific instance of a Book, such as Business  Analysis or Data Analysis for Data Base Design. The physical equivalent of an entity  type is a table, and of entity occurrence a record. We usually talk about ‘entities’ as  an abbreviation of ‘entity types’ but specifically refer to entity occurrences.",556,92,139.0
259,"Individual  occurrences of an entity must be uniquely identifiable. For example, each customer or  order must have a unique identifier such as account-number or order-number. Attributes Entities contain and are described by attributes (or more accurately attribute types).  For example, the entity Book might be described by the attributes title, author-name,  publisher and price. Attributes may also be called data items.",423,61,105.75
259,"An attribute’s physical  equivalent is a field. A specific entity occurrence should be uniquely identifiable by  the value of an attribute or combination of attributes. For example a Member may  be identified by the attribute member-number or a specific Book recognised from  the combination of the two attributes author and title. This identifying attribute or  combination of attributes is termed the key to the entity. The initial entities and some  attributes will be identified from the interview notes, documents and observations  made in the fact finding and investigation of the current system.",602,92,150.5
259,Existing file or  database content and information needs also give pointers to system entities and their  229,109,17,27.25
260,BUSINESS ANALYSIS attributes. Attributes are not generally shown on the entity relationship diagram itself  but are typically defined in supporting documentation (entity descriptions) or recorded  in a data dictionary. Relationships A relationship is a relevant business connection between two entities. A relationship  is represented on a data model by a line linking the associated entities. Relationships  may be: yy one-to-many (1:m); yy one-to-one (1:1); yy many-to-many (m:m).,482,67,120.5
260,"It is good practice to name the relationships on the model so as to provide anyone  viewing it with more information about the nature of the relationship. This is discussed  later in this chapter. One-to-many relationships Relationships are often of the degree one-to-many (1:m). For example, an Employee is  allocated to one Office, but each Office must have one or more Employees allocated to  it. We represent this as shown in Figure 12.5.",442,73,110.5
260,"Here, the notation of a ‘crow’s foot’ is used  to indicate that an Office is related to between one and many Employees. At the other  end of the line, a solid line indicates that an Employee is related to exactly one Office.  Figure 12.5  One-to-many relationship between two entities Figure E12.5 Similarly, in an order processing entity model there appears to be an obvious 1:m  relationship between Customer and Order. A customer will place one or many orders  but a particular order will only be placed by only one Customer.  230",533,91,133.25
261,"MODELLING REQUIREMENTS One-to-one relationships If we were looking at a system to hold data about a company, its offices and the  employees working in the offices and each office was allocated to only one employee  and each employee allocated to only one office, then the relationship between Office and  Employee would be one-to-one. Similarly, as shown in Figure 12.6, an order is related to  one invoice and an invoice is concerned with only one order. The relationship between  the two entities is exactly one-to-one. A solid line is used to indicate that the relationship  is exactly one. Figure 12.6  One-to-one relationship between two entities Figur e 12.6 These relationships are not permitted in some data modelling approaches and, where  this is the case, it is usually suggested that the two entities are merged.",824,133,206.0
261,"If this happens,  one of the identifiers is selected to identify the merged set and the entity is named  accordingly. An identifier is the attribute or set of attributes used to identify the entity.  The identifier that is created first is usually used to identify the entity created from the  merged entities. If the Order and Invoice entities from the example above were merged,  the identifier for the Order entity is likely to be the chosen identifier as the order is  created before the Invoice. Optionality More detailed information about the business rules that underpin the data model  is represented by including optionality in the relationship between two entities.",675,109,168.75
261,"The  optionality of the relationship describes whether or not the entities at both ends  of the relationship must always co-exist or whether one entity can exist without  the other entity. Where there is not optionality and both entities must always co- exist, the relationship is drawn using a solid line. In the examples in Figures 12.5  and 12.6, the entities are joined by a solid line. This indicates that both entities  must exist and that neither can be stored on a system without the other being  present; this is sometimes called a fully mandatory relationship. Another example  of this type of relationship is shown in Figure 12.7.",641,107,160.25
261,"In this case, each Order input  to the system must always have at least one Order line and each Order line must  be related to exactly one Order. 231",149,29,37.25
262,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Figure 12.7  Fully mandatory one-to-many relationship Figur e 12.7 The complete opposite of a fully mandatory relationship occurs where a relationship is  fully optional. This means that both entities can exist completely independently of each  other. In the example in Figure 12.8 the relationship is using a dotted line. This indicates  that an Order can be placed without a Customer call being made and a Customer call  need not result in an Order. Figure 12.8  Fully optional one-to-many relationship Figure 12.8 The remaining two alternatives show how relationships need to be analysed in two  directions: from the ‘one’ end of the relationship, known as the parent or master  entity, to the ‘many’ end of the relationship, known as the child or detail entity.",783,125,195.75
262,"The  first situation is where a parent entity can exist without any child entities but a child  entity must have a parent. In the example in Figure 12.9 we can see that a Customer  may not have placed any Orders as yet, but an Order must always be placed by a  Customer. 232",274,53,68.5
263,"MODELLING REQUIREMENTS Figure 12.9  Mandatory parent entity with optional child entity Figure 1 2.9 The second situation is the opposite of this, where the parent entity must be linked  to at least one child, but the child entities can exist without a parent. The example in  Figure 12.10 shows that an Order need not be related to any Complaints but a Complaint  must concern at least one Order. Figure 12.10  Optional parent entity with mandatory child entity Figure 12 .10 Many-to-many relationships Many-to-many (m:m) relationships occur frequently. For example, as shown in  Figure 12.11, an employee may be contracted to work on one or more projects and a  project may have one or more employees contracted to it. 233",723,119,180.75
264,BUSINESS ANALYSIS Figure 12.11  Many-to-many relationship Figure 1 2.11 Many-to-many relationships are normally decomposed into two 1:m relationships with  the definition of an additional link entity. Figure 12.12 shows how the link entity Contract  has been added so that the many-to-many relationship can be removed. The extended  structure shows the following: yy an Employee is linked to one or more Contracts and a Contract is for exactly  one Employee; yy a Project is linked to one or more Contracts and a Contract is for exactly one  Project. Figure 12.12  Resolved many-to-many relationship Figure  12.12 This allows all the contract details which an individual employee is associated with to  be accessed as detail entity occurrences. It also allows access from the project entity to  all the contracts associated with a specific project occurrence.,859,132,214.75
264,"Attributes of the original  relationship, for example, ‘date employee contracted to the project’ and ‘duration of each  contract’, can now be recorded as attributes of the link entity. Note that the name of the  link entity is normally the noun form of the verb which described the relationship, thus  the contracted relationship is replaced by a Contract entity. 234",367,59,91.75
265,"MODELLING REQUIREMENTS If we look at an order processing example there appears to be a many-to-many  relationship between the entities Product and Order. An order may be for more than  one product and we would expect most products to be ordered more than once so  they would appear on more than one order. This is solved by introducing a link entity  (Order line) which has one-to-many relationships with both of the original entities. ( This  structure is shown on the diagram in Figure 12.15.) Many-to-many relationships can be problematic for at least two important reasons: yy First, they may mask omitted entities.",619,102,154.75
265,"Two examples have already been given  above. yy Second, most Data Base Management Systems (DBMS) do not support many-to- many relationships. Relationship names The nature of the relationship between two entities is clarified by relationship naming  and identification. A relationship link phrase is constructed from the perspective of each  entity. In the example in Figure 12.13, a Sales region is responsible for zero, one or more  Customers.",444,67,111.0
265,"Figure 12.13  Named relationship between entities Figure 12.13 This reads from the Sales region end as: each Sales region may be responsible for one or more Customers and from the Customer end: each Customer must be allocated to exactly one and only one Sales region Exclusive relationships In an exclusive relationship, the participation of an entity occurrence in one relationship  precludes it from participating in another. This is indicated by an exclusivity arc  (Figure 12.14). 235",488,76,122.0
266,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Figure 12.14  Exclusive relationships Figure  12.14 In Figure 12.14, the diagram uses the exclusive arc notation to show that: yy each Employee must be allocated to one and only one Sales region or to one  and only one Office; yy each Office is occupied by one or more Employees; yy each Sales region has one or more Employees. The exclusive relationship may extend to more than two alternatives. For example, if the  Employee could be allocated to a Sales region, Office or Data centre, there would be  three entities related to Employee and the exclusive arc would extend across all three  relationships. Entity relationship diagram for the sales system If we put these examples together we can build an entity relationship diagram  (Figure 12.15) that reflects the data requirements for our system. Figure 12.15  Entity relationship diagram for a sales system Figure  12.14 236",898,146,224.5
267,MODELLING REQUIREMENTS Alternative notation There are many notations used when modelling data. Class modelling from the UML is  such an alternative and is described below. A further alternative uses horizontal lines to  indicate ‘one’ and circles to indicate optionality. Examples using this notation are shown  in Figure 12.16. Figure 12.16  Alternative data modelling notation Figure E12.1 6 CLASS MODELS A class model shows graphically the classes in a system and their associations with  each other.,503,75,125.75
267,"These models have similarities to entity relationship diagrams and apply  many of the same principles. In a business system, a class model captures information  about the particular things involved in the organisation’s operations, for example  projects, customers and team members for a project control system.  Objects An object is something that we wish to hold data about because that data is needed  within the system we are analysing. For example, an object might be Order number  UK74563 and we may wish to hold the following information about this object: 237",567,90,141.75
268,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Order number:	 UK74563 Customer:	 C66430 Date placed:	 25 August Date fulfilled:	 1 September Total value:	 £147.50 Objects are sent messages that invoke them to respond in some way, typically by  changing data. For example, a message might be sent to the object UK74563 to change  the date the order was fulfilled. Classes To build a model of the system data we consider classes of objects rather than individual  objects. We explained earlier the difference between entity types and entity occurrences.  Similarly, in object class modelling, we have classes that provide the generic definition of  the data items or attributes, and objects that are the instances of a particular class.",705,111,176.25
268,"Thus  order UK74563 is an object of the class Order. The class Order Account has attributes  such as orderNumber and totalValue and, as we saw above, the object UK74563  has values associated with these attributes. When we define a class we also include  operations that the Order is subject to. These might include updateDateFulfilled and  recordDatePlaced. All of the orders in the system will contain these attributes and be  subject to the same operations.",460,74,115.0
268,"A class, therefore, is a template for its object instances  in the same way that an entity type is the template for its entity occurrences. Every  object is an instance of some class that defines the common set of features (attributes  and operations) that are shared by all objects in that class. In the UML, classes are represented by rectangular boxes with three sections. The name  of the class is shown in the top part and is a noun. The first letter is capitalised, for  example, Order, Customer and Complaint.",516,90,129.0
268,"If the name has more than one word then  each word is joined and capitalised in the class name, for example, OrderLine. The attributes – the individual items of data about the class – are stored in the middle  section. The attribute names are usually shown in lower case with constituent parts  shown with a capital letter. The first letter of the attribute name is not capitalised, for  example, orderNumber, customer and datePlaced. Operations are stored in the bottom part of the class and are invoked by messages being  sent to the class by other classes.",559,96,139.75
268,It is usual to name the operation in the class with the  same name as the message. The detailed content of the operation – what the class will  do when that operation is invoked – will be defined in the method associated with the  operation; this is usually left to the later stages of the development process.  Attributes held within a class are only accessible to the operations of that class as they  are hidden from all other classes in the system. This is known as encapsulation and is  an important principle of the object-oriented approach. Any other part of the system  that needs to access or modify the data of that class has no need to understand how it  is structured.,680,122,170.0
268,It just sends a message and the receiving class responds appropriately.  238,76,12,19.0
269,"MODELLING REQUIREMENTS For example, in Figure 12.17 the object class Order has the operation updateDateFulfilled  which may take place when all of the goods have been despatched to the customer. To  enable this to take place a message is sent to the object Order to updateDateFulfilled  and the parameters of orderNumber, newDateFulfilled are also sent to indicate the  order in question and the new date fulfilled. In the class Order, we have defined an  operation also called updateDateFulfilled to respond to the message of the same name.  This operation has been specified as ‘replace dateFulfilled with new dateFulfilled’  which uses the value passed in the message to update the date on the appropriate  order.  Figure 12.17  Definition of the class ‘Order’ Figur e 12.17 Associations As in entity relationship modelling, we now need to establish how different classes  are linked to each other and the nature of these connections.",937,149,234.25
269,"We call the connections  between classes ‘associations’. For instance, an Order class must have an association  with an OrderLine class so that the system will be able to identify the items on the order.  Figure 12.18 shows this association. Figure 12.18  Association between two classes Figur e 12.18 239",305,49,76.25
270,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS We have already said that classes interact and this is done by the messages moving  along the association lines defined in the class model. If there is no association between  classes, then they cannot communicate directly.  The class model reflects the business rules that will govern the classes and the  operations performed upon them. Multiplicity is used to show the business rules for  an association between classes. For example, the multiplicity of the association shown  in Figure 12.19 indicates that an Order may include many Order lines but an individual  Order line project may only be part of one Order.",635,102,158.75
270,"Figure 12.19  Association showing one-to-many multiplicity Figur e 12.19 The multiplicity entries can be extended to show the minimum and maximum values  in the association. This is shown using two dots between the minimum and maximum  values. For example the asterisk in the example in Figure 12.19 is a simplification of the  range 0..* and the ‘1’ is a simplification of 1..1.  The JobSheet to Task association shown in Figure 12.20 shows that an instance of Task  has an optional association with JobSheet. In addition, this shows that, although there  may be no JobSheets associated with a Task, there is also a maximum of one JobSheet  for a given Task.",659,110,164.75

271,"MODELLING REQUIREMENTS In the example in Figure 12.21, the class Customer has a mandatory association with  Order. There must be at least one instance of Order for each instance of Customer  (though the asterisk indicates there is no upper limit). An Order is for only one Customer.  (This shows, by the way, how associations are manifestations of business rules, in this  case that in this organisation a customer is defined as someone who has placed at least  one order with us.)

Figure 12.22  Association showing defined range of multiplicity Figure  12.22 The class model supports associations where the multiplicity is many to many. For  example, Figure 12.23 shows that a Project may have many ProjectManagers and  each ProjectManager may control many Projects. Should this happen, it is likely that  this would occur over a period of time. The zeroes on this diagram indicate that a  ProjectManager may be newly appointed and thus not yet have been allocated a Project;  and that a Project may be set up without knowing the name of the ProjectManager.",737,124,184.25
271,241,3,1,0.75
272,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Figure 12.23  Association with many:many multiplicity Figure 12.23 In some circumstances, the association between the classes also holds information.  If we consider the example in Figure 12.23, we would probably want to know which  ProjectManager was in charge of a project during a particular period. To do this we  create an association class called Assignment to hold the start and end date for each  ProjectManager. Figure 12.24 shows this additional class. Figure 12.24  An association class Figure  12.24 In this example, there is only one instance of the class Assignment for each combination  of Project and ProjectManager.",650,99,162.5
272,"If there were more than one – for example, if a  ProjectManager could be reassigned to a Project they had previously left – then it would  be necessary to convert this association class into a class in its own right.  Generalisation and inheritance Sometimes, as we get further into the analysis, we discover that there are different  sub-categories for a class. For instance, a general and a private are both soldiers but  while some of the information that we would like to hold about them is the same, other  information may differ greatly. UML handles this situation through a concept known as  generalisation and this is illustrated in Figure 12.25. 242",658,111,164.5
273,"MODELLING REQUIREMENTS Figure 12.25  Generalisation structure Figure 12.25 Figure 12.25 shows that some attributes are shared by all employees, whether they are  office-based or work in sales. So, these are shown in the general class called Employee.  However, other details are very different for office employees and sales employees so  different attributes are held for them. The upward-facing arrow indicates that these two  sub-classes inherit the attributes of the generalised class. When we come to identify associations with other classes, we may find that some are  with the generalisation class and some are only with one or either of the sub-classes.",661,101,165.25
273," This is illustrated in Figure 12.26. Class model for the sales system By way of comparing the two different approaches, Figure 12.26 is the sales system  shown as a UML class model that was previously modelled as an entity relationship  diagram in Figure 12.15. The UML notation does not cover the ‘exclusive relationship’ between employee and  office or region shown in Figure 12.15 and so, in Figure 12.26, this is addressed in  a different way. CustomerCall is associated with the generalised class Employee and  then a specific type of employee, OfficeEmployee, is associated with Office. Similarly,  SalesPerson is associated with SalesRegion.",649,101,162.25

Indeed, the Agile Manifesto stated that working software is valued over  comprehensive documentation. However, the Manifesto does not say that there is no value in documentation, only  that working software is more valuable. It is our view that, even in an Agile project,  models can be useful to help the user community understand the scope and scale of the  proposed system before detailed development commences. In addition, once the system  is delivered, there is the question of ongoing maintenance to consider and models can  be invaluable to the maintenance team, as described in the next section.",895,146,223.75

275,"MODELLING REQUIREMENTS THE USE OF MODELS IN SYSTEM MAINTENANCE It is a fact that, if the lifetime cost of an IT system is considered, by far the bulk of  the expenditure – 70 per cent according to some authorities – is incurred after the  system has been implemented. This is because errors are discovered in the software  that have to be fixed and, of course, the users require changes to the system to meet  their changing business needs. A common problem that faces support and maintenance teams – which often consist  of different people and sometimes even different firms than originally built the system  – is understanding the overall scope of a system and how it all fits together. In addition,  although inspection of the code can usually reveal how a system works, the business  reasons for it being built that way are often lost in the mists of time. It is here that models can prove invaluable, whether the system was created using Agile or  more conventional development methods.",992,170,248.0
275,"Use case diagrams can help the support staff to  understand the overall shape of the system and data models, either ERDs or class models,  capture the business rules that control the creation, manipulation and deletion of data. SUMMARY This chapter has provided an introduction to some of the key techniques used to model  system requirements. The benefit of using models is that they provide an unambiguous  view of the system, albeit from one specific perspective. Another benefit is that these  views may be compared and cross-checked. So we might develop a use case diagram  and cross-check it against a model of the data in order to identify any gaps such as  missing data items or use cases.",697,117,174.25

The business analysis work could provide the basis for a large scale, broad  scope business change programme or could be much more focused on a particular  area. As a result, delivering the requirements could include some or all of: yy Business process changes: the business processes may be altered to be  simpler, faster, more accurate or more effective. yy People changes: the jobs of the people involved may be redefined and new  tasks and skills added. In turn, this gives rise to further requirements for  training, coaching or mentoring, and to changes in the way people are recruited  and appraised.",780,125,195.0
276,"yy Changes to organisational structure: often, posts disappear, new ones  are created and sections or departments are merged or split. Sometimes,  introducing a new structure (projects, for example) is seen as key to the  business improvements sought. yy Changes to the IT systems: the software that supports the business processes  may need to be enhanced or replaced in order to provide the features and  information used by the organisation. These elements must not be considered in isolation and it is important that the  business analyst keeps their interdependence in mind. A holistic approach to the  delivery of the requirements is essential for the successful delivery of the changes to  the business.",710,111,177.5
276," DELIVERING THE SOLUTION There are several lifecycles, methods and standards that may be used when developing  solutions to meet the requirements.

277,DELIVERING THE REQUIREMENTS Figure 13.1  Factors in deciding the delivery approach Figure 13. 1 The elements are concerned with the following areas: yy Context: the nature of the organisation and project that will provide the basis  for deciding how the solution will be delivered. yy Lifecycle: the process adopted for developing and implementing the solution. yy Approach: the methods and standards that are used during the lifecycle. yy Roles: the key roles to be filled during the project.,493,78,123.25

CONTEXT The context for the organisation and the project will provide the basis for deciding how  any business changes are to be delivered. Organisations are subject to external pressures  from customers, competitors and other business demands and these usually determine  the need for change and the constraints within which those changes need to be met.",605,93,151.25
277,"For  example, if an organisation works in a safety-critical or highly regulated environment it  may be essential for the entire set of change requirements to be defined in great detail and  implemented in one group. Alternatively, if an organisation operates in a highly competitive  business environment then it is likely that a rapid response to change will be required.

278,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS 	 of the business domain within which it operates, what are the values and beliefs  of the senior managers? yy The business context for the proposed changes: for example, what is the  organisation hoping to achieve in terms of business benefit as a result of this  project? yy Any constraints that impinge upon the project: for example, what is the  timescale for delivering the solution, what is the budget, what resources are to  be made available, what standards does the organisation use? yy The prioritised needs of the business: for example, improved public image  may be more important than cost savings or alternatively, reducing costs may  be the top priority. yy The drivers for the project: for example, is this project based upon a need  to comply with new legislation or is it concerned with offering additional or  enhanced services to customers?",878,143,219.5
278,"The context will vary from project to project or across change programmes. Whichever  is the case, it is important that this is understood in order to determine that we adopt  the most appropriate approach to deliver the requirements. DELIVERY LIFECYCLE The business change lifecycle defined in Chapter 1 and reproduced in Figure 13.2 shows  in overview the sequence of stages to be carried out when analysing, developing and  delivering business changes.  Figure 13.2   The business change lifecycle Figure 13.2 248",516,80,129.0
279,"DELIVERING THE REQUIREMENTS However, while this lifecycle shows in overview the areas of business change activity  needed, it does not indicate how the solution is developed and delivered. There has been  a great deal of effort devoted to defining lifecycles for IT systems development and it is  important to understand the nature of these lifecycles as they provide a clear basis for  the project work. Although they focus on software development, it is important to align  this work with the broader business changes, such as the definition of new processes  and revised job roles. The systems development lifecycles are described below. The concept of a systems development lifecycle The development approaches to IT systems are known as systems development  lifecycles (SDLCs).",782,121,195.5
279,"These approaches have evolved over many years and are based  upon underpinning philosophies that determine the route taken from analysis through  to deployment of the system solutions.  A systems development lifecycle sets out the stages, and their sequence, that are  undertaken in the process to develop and implement an IT system. The lifecycle covers the  entire life of a system from feasibility study to operation. There are two main philosophies  that underpin systems development lifecycles: the linear approach, whereby steps are  carried out in sequence and are completed before moving on; and the evolutionary  approach, whereby the solution to be delivered emerges during iterative periods of  software development based upon the use of prototyping and multi-disciplinary teams.  The earliest established model of a linear SDLC is the waterfall lifecycle but, over  the years, variants and alternatives have been devised and each has advantages and  disadvantages.",976,145,244.0
279," The waterfall lifecycle The waterfall lifecycle, illustrated in Figure 13.3, shows the development proceeding  through a series of sequential stages. In theory, each is reviewed and signed off  before the next starts. Thus, we should only begin analysis once a feasibility study  Figure 13.3  The waterfall lifecycle Figure 13.3 249",333,50,83.25
280,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS has been approved, and design should be based on an agreed set of requirements  from the analysis. The backwards-facing arrows in the lifecycle indicate the need to  check back at each stage to ensure that the project has not expanded its defined scope,  that the present stage builds logically on its predecessor and that modifications to the  deliverables from the previous stage may be made where required. BAs would typically be involved in the feasibility study and analysis stages of the  project. They would also probably assist in the user acceptance that forms part of the  testing stage and help the business users during implementation. During design and  development, BAs would be available to answer queries about the business and solution  requirements raised by the development team.",816,129,204.0
280,"The principal benefit of the waterfall lifecycle is that it provides good control from a  project management perspective. In addition, the requirement to sign off each stage  before the next one starts should lead to a high-quality system. However, the highly  structured nature of this lifecycle is also its weakness as it can lead to a long-drawn-out  development that can leave the business in limbo. In addition, it does not handle change  particularly well since a whole sequence of deliverables may require adjustments to  adapt to the change; for example, a change that occurs during development would  require adjustments to the analysis and design documentation and possibly to the  feasibility study as well. The ‘V’ model  The ‘V’ model, shown in Figure 13.4, is a variant of the waterfall model and consists of  similar stages and sequence of the work.",864,140,216.0
280,"Figure 13.4  The ‘V’ model Figure  13.4 While the ‘V’ model is based upon the same principles as the waterfall lifecycle, in  effect the waterfall has been bent back on itself following the development activity.  This adds another dimension, showing explicitly the connection between the earlier –  developmental stages of the project and the later – testing – stages. In particular, the  derivation and usage of the test criteria is made explicit at each stage, for example,  showing how the acceptance criteria should be defined as part of the requirements  documentation and used during user acceptance testing. 250",618,98,154.5
281,"DELIVERING THE REQUIREMENTS An extended ‘V’ model has been developed to show the context and nature of business  analysis work. This model is shown in Figure 13.5.  Figure 13.5  Extended ‘V’ model Figure  13.5 In this model, the initial work concerns an analysis of the business needs and the  development of the business case that justifies the recommended solution. This  solution sets out the scope of the business change work to be explored further in the  requirements definition stage. Again the corresponding leg of the ‘V’ model shows how  the deliverables from the initial stages are used in testing the solution.",622,101,155.5
281,"The business  case is used during the benefits review to test the success of the recommended  solution by reviewing the predicted business benefits against those delivered by the  new business system. The aim is to confirm that the benefits have been achieved, or  ‘realised’, and to identify further actions if this has not yet happened. This model is  also used to show the range of business analysis work in the light of an IT solution  lifecycle. As can be seen in Figure 13.5, the business analyst is involved at the outset  in assessing the business needs and defining the requirements. The later activities of  ensuring user acceptance and reviewing the benefits also form part of the business  analyst role.",715,119,178.75
281,"Business analysis is not shown within the other stages of the lifecycle as  they focus on the design, development and testing of the IT element of the solution. The  design, development and testing stages are primarily the remit of technical architects,  developers and software testers. However, the business analyst should still be involved  during these stages for the following reasons: yy to ensure that the business needs continue to be met;  yy to develop the process and job role definitions that will be implemented  alongside the IT solution; yy to assess the impact of proposed changes. 251",601,97,150.25
282,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Incremental delivery When analysing the requirements for the business change solution, some requirements  will be more important, or more urgent, than others. For example, a regulatory deadline  or an expected move by a competitor may make it imperative to implement some  requirements quickly whereas others may be less urgent and can be delivered at a  later point. One way of achieving this is to develop and deliver the solution in a series  of increments. The incremental delivery lifecycle is illustrated in Figure 13.6 and  shows the analysis and design for the solution being completed initially. This is then  followed by two incremental delivery phases, each consisting of development, testing  and implementation.",742,113,185.5
282,"The most pressing requirements are in increment 1 and the rest  follow in increment 2. Figure 13.6  Incremental lifecycle Figure  13.6 Something to be remembered if using the incremental lifecycle is that the total  cost of delivering the solution is likely to be higher than delivering the solution in  one release. This is because of the need to ensure that each increment will not  compromise the system when it is implemented. Also, in the second and subsequent  increments, it will be necessary to carry out a specific form of testing known as  regression testing, to make sure that the additional features do not cause something  already implemented to stop working. What is more, the high-level analysis and  design for the solution needs to be defined in order to future-proof the design for  the later increments.",822,135,205.5
282,"If this is not done, aspects of the solution may be discovered  during later increments that will necessitate changes to parts of the system already  implemented. This lifecycle shows both incremental development and delivery while  utilising the structure of sequential stages defined in the waterfall lifecycle. The need  for a complete set of requirements and an overall design is one of the fundamental  252",411,64,102.75
283,"DELIVERING THE REQUIREMENTS differences between the incremental lifecycle, described here, and the iterative  approach which is described next.  Iterative systems development  A feature common to the waterfall, ‘V’ and incremental models is that a complete  set of requirements is gathered at the start of the project and these form the basis  for all subsequent work. An alternative approach is sometimes represented by a  spiral model which was originally devised by Barry Boehm in his article: ‘A spiral  model of software development and enhancement’ (Boehm 1986). Boehm’s original  perception of the spiral model incorporated the concept of iterations (or ‘rounds’ as  Boehm called them) and used prototyping to reduce risk when developing software  for complex situations. This developed into the basis for early Agile approaches such  as Rapid Application Development.",875,129,218.75
283,"With the advent of Agile methods such as DSDM  and Scrum, iterative development has increasingly used prototyping and related  techniques in order to evolve the detailed requirements and the corresponding  software features.  The iterative development approach is founded upon some fundamental generic  principles: yy Evolutionary – Detailed requirements are evolved through a series of iterative  prototyping development stages. yy Empowerment and collaboration – It is a fundamental requirement that the  team, including business staff and IT developers, are empowered to make  decisions during the software development and work as a collaborative team. yy Fitness for purpose – The deliverables are required to be fit for purpose rather  than aligned slavishly with a set of defined requirements.  yy Testing all the time – Testing is an integral part of the iterative development  approach so the software should be tested continuously.",940,139,235.0
283,"Automated testing  tools are very useful in doing this. yy Re-factoring – Iterative development adopts an exploratory approach so any  work may be reversed if it does not add value. This is not perceived as being a  mistake or waste of time but instead as an integral part of the iterative process.  yy Incremental delivery – The system is likely to be deployed in increments, with  each subsequent increment providing additional functionality or improved  performance. yy Prioritisation – An approach such as MoSCoW (see Chapter 11) is used to  identify the different levels of priority amongst the features to be delivered.",625,101,156.25

Identify options and	 A feasibility study is conducted to determine the  feasibility	 options that the business might pursue in order to  address the business need.

285,"The dotted arrows show optional  revisiting of previous stages. Advantages and disadvantages of the lifecycles The waterfall, ‘V’ model and incremental lifecycles incorporate a high level of control  which offers many advantages. However, in practice there are some real difficulties in  the way: yy There may not be time to define all the requirements at the outset and only the  most important or urgent ones can be defined in the time available. yy It is unlikely that the business actors will know exactly what they want,  particularly if they are moving into new and uncharted areas of business. Even  if they are reasonably knowledgeable about the requirements, it is likely that  255",690,112,172.5
286,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS 	 there will be areas where they are less certain. These areas could concern the  exact details for some requirements or non-functional aspects. yy It is important to establish some of the business changes quickly in order  to demonstrate capability and achievement, and keep the support of the key  stakeholders. yy The pace of business change is so rapid these days that a completely defined  set of requirements can become out-of-date very quickly. The most flexible delivery approach is achieved by utilising iterative development with  incremental delivery together, in a co-ordinated and controlled way.",627,95,156.75
286,"This is the approach  adopted during Agile software development, for example, using methods such as Scrum  or DSDM which are described later in the chapter. Developing the business solution While the lifecycles described above are concerned with software development, the  basic principles also apply to other business changes. For example, where the project  is concerned with business process improvement, the requirements for the new  processes may be defined prior to the development of the processes or an explorative,  evolutionary approach may be adopted. Given that most requirements are delivered  through a mix of IT and process changes, the lifecycle chosen for the software elements  may impose a lifecycle and constraints on the other aspects of the business solution.  For example, where an incremental software release is to be delivered, we will need  to define the process, task and job changes that will make that increment workable in  practice, and these may need to change again with the release of the next increment.",1039,162,259.75
286," Where a complete solution is to be implemented, the entire set of process, task and job  definitions will be required at the same point. DEVELOPMENT AND DELIVERY APPROACH Whichever lifecycle is adopted it will also be necessary to select an approach to carrying  out the project work. The approach will determine the methods and standards to be  adopted on the project. There are several published approaches to business process  improvement and software development that offer techniques and standards. The  Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a popular approach, providing a range of modelling  techniques that may be used to represent different views of a system.",666,104,166.5
286,"Organisations will  need to take account of the context and the lifecycles described above when deciding  which approach to adopt. In deciding this, there are two key areas that should be  considered: the approaches to the development and the delivery of the solution. yy Development: there are two key questions to answer:  ß are we able to work collaboratively with the business users during the  development of the solution or is this not possible?  ß are the requirements unclear or well understood?  When deciding on the development approach, we need to consider if the detailed  requirements will need to be defined by working collaboratively with the business users  256",679,109,169.75
287,"DELIVERING THE REQUIREMENTS during the solution development. Where this is the case, it is vital that the business users  are available to work closely with the project team so that the detail of the requirements  may be uncovered as the solution evolves. Techniques such as scenario analysis  and prototyping will be invaluable in this situation. However, if the requirements are  sufficiently well understood to be defined prior to the solution development and testing,  and there is likely to be limited contact with the business users, formal documentation  techniques, such as detailed process and data models and a well-formed requirements  catalogue, will be needed.  yy Delivery: do we require one delivery of the entire solution or a phased delivery  using incremental releases?",787,121,196.75
287,"The context described above will provide the  basis for deciding whether the organisation requires the delivery of all of the  requirements in one release, or if a phased approach that delivers incremental  change, is necessary. Software development approaches There are several published, defined approaches to developing software solutions, each  of which provides a framework and standards. Two key approaches are described below. The Unified Process (UP) from the Object Management Group (OMG) is a generic  software development process which can be configured to meet the requirements  of an organisation. Its structure acknowledges that no single development process  fits all organisations, development environments and cultures.",736,104,184.0
287,It is designed to fit  small releases such as enhancements to existing systems as well as large systems  development projects. The UP provides a guide on how to use the Unified Modeling  Language (UML) effectively; techniques from the UML are discussed in Chapter 12. The  UP is both an iterative and incremental approach. It is based upon the principle of using  UML modelling techniques to explore and elaborate requirements through a series of  iterations. Increments are developed that may be combined for one release of the entire  solution or may be implemented as phased releases.,587,95,146.75
287,"Agile software development approaches include DSDM and Scrum. In recent years,  these have become increasingly popular in organisations for a number of reasons: yy The need for organisations to respond quickly to fast-changing business  situations. yy The difficulty – indeed, sometimes the impossibility – of knowing what is wanted  at an early stage of the project. yy The importance of flexibility when deciding how a requirement will be delivered.  For example, a requirement may be defined to protect certain areas of the data  but there may be several possibilities as to how this is achieved.",599,95,149.75
287,The solution  to deliver this requirement may be decided through an exploration of various  mechanisms. The Agile methods provide a means of developing IT systems using an iterative approach  while still ensuring the quality of the software solution. This approach assumes that  it is impractical to expect that systems can be built during one development phase  for the entire system. It is based upon the principle that 80 per cent of a solution  257,452,74,113.0
288,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS can be delivered using 20 per cent of the development effort needed to produce the  total solution. When using an Agile approach, there is the danger that the emerging  prototype systems are not documented sufficiently or are not coherent, which leads to  considerable difficulties later when they are in live operation. The methods described  here address this danger quite explicitly and stress the need for documentation and  testing throughout the development activity. Scrum is a widely adopted manifestation of the Agile approach. The name refers to  the method of re-starting a game of rugby after an infringement of the rules and, in  the method, is the name given to the daily progress meeting between members of the  development team.",762,121,190.5
288,"The ScrumMaster is a facilitator for these meetings but is not a  project manager in the conventional planning and directive sense. The development  team is self-governing and is guided in its work by the product owner who acts as the  ‘voice of the customer’. In a Scrum project, the development work proceeds in a series of ‘sprints’ which are  timeboxed periods of effort, typically from one week to one month in duration. At  the start of each sprint, there is a sprint planning meeting where the product owner  nominates the work to be done by selecting tasks from the ‘product backlog’. The daily  Scrum meetings focus on what has been accomplished yesterday, what is planned for  today and what obstacles have been encountered.",734,123,183.5
288,"As with other Agile approaches, Scrum depends on close co-operation between the user  community (represented by the product owner) and the developers, and on the ability to  prioritise the work to be done. Prioritisation is explored in more detail in the next section. The importance of prioritisation Prioritisation is extremely important during solution development as there are always  many requirements and limitations on time and budget. Clearly, all requirements are  not deemed of equal importance, and this helps determine what should go into each  work package or iteration. Whichever approach is adopted, it will be important to identify  where the priorities lie in order to ensure that the available effort and funding is targeted  at the requirements designated the highest priority.",796,121,199.0
288,"Careful and accurate prioritisation  is vital if we are using an incremental delivery lifecycle, possibly combined with iterative  development. It is here that a prioritisation scheme such as DSDM’s MoSCoW structure,  which was introduced in Chapter 11, is particularly relevant. The MoSCoW prioritisation  categories are related to the development and delivery of the solution as follows:  yy ‘Must have’ requirements will be delivered in the first deployed increment; these  form the ‘minimum usable subset’ of requirements. If an iterative development  approach is to be adopted, these requirements will form the first elements of  the prototypes. yy ‘Should have’ requirements provide one of the mechanisms for introducing  contingency and flexibility.",756,109,189.0
288,"They could be implemented as manual ‘work- arounds’ in the short term, which is extremely helpful when deadlines are tight.  Any of these requirements that have not been delivered in the first release will  be allocated a ‘must have’ priority in the second increment. 258",271,45,67.75
289,"DELIVERING THE REQUIREMENTS yy ‘Could have’ requirements may be included in the set of requirements under  development, particularly if they are relatively easy and inexpensive to  incorporate with the higher priority requirements. Where timeboxes are used,  these requirements provide some contingency, as they can be left out should  the development team run out of time. yy Finally, the ‘Want to have but not this time around’ requirements are recognised  as those that will be set aside and considered during one of the later increments.  This is an essential element for incremental delivery approaches as it provides  a means of identifying requirements for later phases of the solution and  specifically annotating them as such. These requirements will be allocated  a different priority once the point arrives for their delivery to be considered.",854,131,213.5
289," For example, there may be a specific date when some of these requirements  become mandatory and, when planning for that release, the ‘W’ prioritisation  may be changed to an ‘M’. The MoSCoW approach is also extremely useful for prioritising other types of business  changes. For example, when developing process documentation we can identify the  elements that must be included at the outset, those that can wait for the next version and  those that could be dropped if we run out of time; or when developing team capability,  we can prioritise the different skills into the MoSCoW categories in order to highlight  those that are most important and those that can be deferred, even if only for a short  time. Use case diagrams, described in Chapter 12, are also useful in prioritisation as they  can provide a highly visual way for business actors and developers to understand the  level of priority assigned to each of the use cases. While modelling the potential scope  of the entire solution, a use case diagram can be used to partition the solution into  practical implementation packages for the short or longer term and provide a means of  considering the different options available to deliver the business requirements.",1229,202,307.25
289," Software package approach So far in this chapter, we have considered the lifecycles and approaches that may  be used when developing a software solution, using either an in-house development  team or an outsourced software development supplier. However, in many situations,  organisations prefer to adopt commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions where possible,  using these to implement best practice and engender related business process changes.  The reasons are not hard to find: yy A COTS solution is almost certainly going to be cheaper than the organisation  having to fund the entire development process since, by definition, the  development costs are shared by all the users of the package. yy Implementation should be faster, as the solution exists and only has to be set  up in the way the customer wants. yy Support and maintenance packages are available from the software vendors.",896,138,224.0
289,"yy COTS vendors keep their software up to date, for example in line with changes  in legislation. 259",101,18,25.25
290,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS As against these advantages, however, there are some drawbacks, including: yy No COTS package is likely to be a perfect fit with the requirements, so either the  customer must adapt their processes to what the package can do or they must  pay for expensive tailoring and customisation, thereby partly negating one of  the benefits of the COTS approach. yy If competitive advantage is required, it is unlikely to come from a software  package, since all organisations working in a particular business domain  can buy the same software and adopt the same work practices. However, the  deployment and use of the software also needs to be done effectively, which  may offer an opportunity for differentiation from competitors. If a COTS solution is desired, care must be taken that the requirements focus on what the  system is required to do, rather than how it is expected to work (unless the ‘how’ really  is vital to the business, for example to improve competitiveness). And the most effective  use of a software package requires a willingness to change the business processes and  procedures where necessary to align with how the package works.",1164,190,291.0
290," Whichever approach is taken – bespoke development or COTS solution – and whichever  lifecycle and approach are chosen if the former is selected, the business actors must  make a decision on how far they want to go with automating the processes and jobs.  For example, there may be situations, such as those requiring complex decision-making,  where it is preferable for the work to be undertaken manually by staff who can make  judgements on a case-by-case basis. ROLES  The roles that are required to deliver the solution will depend upon these three factors: yy the context of the organisation and project;  yy the nature of the lifecycle selected; yy the approach adopted. Typically, there will be a project team that will include the following roles: yy project manager; yy business analyst; yy developer; yy tester. However, the point at which these roles are required will differ depending upon the  nature of the solution, the lifecycle to be used and the approach chosen.",980,161,245.0

However, if a software solution is  required and an Agile approach is adopted, a collaborative project team that includes  development and testing skills will need to be set up at an early point. Whichever  approach is adopted, there may also be a need for other roles. For example, a technical  architect may be needed where the solution to be developed is complex and needs to  be integrated with other software applications. Or, a data analyst may be needed where  the software is underpinned by a complex data structure that will need to be designed  carefully to ensure that all of the requirements and business rules are understood.",803,133,200.75
291,"Within the business community there are also key roles such as that of the project  sponsor and the business user. These roles play an essential part in the development  of the solutions. The project sponsor is the business representative who is the point  of contact for the project manager and is responsible for providing the resources  to the project team. The business users provide the details of the requirements.  However, the nature of the work carried out by these roles, in particular that of the  business user, will vary depending upon the approach adopted.",570,94,142.5

Where an Agile approach is  adopted, the business users have to work collaboratively with the development team  during the software development.  DELIVERABLES The products that are to be delivered will also vary depending upon the nature of the  solution, the standards of the organisation and the lifecycle and approach adopted.  Sometimes we can deliver the requirements through a training exercise to improve the  skills of the business users. In this case, the deliverables may be course descriptions and  training manuals.",698,107,174.5
291,"Sometimes, the business rules applied by the business users need to  be defined and documented and a follow-on training exercise conducted. In this case,  the deliverables will also include the procedure descriptions. Where business process  changes are aligned with or supported by IT systems changes, the deliverables will be  more extensive and will be linked to the software development lifecycle and approach.  Early methods for systems analysis and design, such as the structured systems analysis  and design method (SSADM), placed a strong emphasis on formal documentation  throughout all stages of the systems development lifecycle. While this method is rarely  used these days, some of the principles concerning documentation are still applied.",753,111,188.25
291,"For  example, many organisations develop extensive requirements documentation prior to  deciding upon the delivery approach, and maintain that documentation throughout the  development lifecycle. Where an iterative development approach is to be adopted most  organisations document the requirements in overview before exploring the selected  requirements set in greater detail through the use of prototyping techniques. In this  situation, the deliverables include the prototypes developed during each iteration.  However, many organisations also enhance the requirements documentation as part  of the iterative development work and ultimately may produce similar deliverables to  those resulting from a waterfall-type lifecycle.

There is little  benefit to be gained (and potentially a lot of time to be wasted) in developing deliverables  that do not contribute to the aims of the project. TECHNIQUES The techniques to be adopted during the development of the solution can vary  considerably from project to project. They will depend upon the scope of the solution,  the standards of the organisation and the lifecycle and approach adopted. Some typical  situations are described below: yy The use of a waterfall-based lifecycle will require the use of formal  documentation that has been reviewed and ‘signed off’.",767,125,191.75
292,"This necessitates  the use of formal and rigorous techniques for documenting and modelling  requirements. For example, a technique such as entity-relationship modelling  or class modelling is likely to be required. yy Where an Agile approach has been adopted for a project, this will determine  the techniques to be used. As stated earlier, prototyping is a vital element of  the Agile approaches but equally techniques such as wireframes, scenarios and  user stories are extremely useful.  yy Organisations may have defined templates for requirements documentation  that include standards for modelling business processes and IT requirements.",643,93,160.75
292," They may also have templates for organisational documents such as job role  definitions and job descriptions.  yy Many organisations have adopted support tools that impose both a development  process and the modelling standards to be used.  SUMMARY All of the aspects described above need to work together to ensure that a coherent  approach to delivering the requirements is adopted. It is important to recognise that  the context for the organisation and the project should determine this. An inappropriate  lifecycle and approach will not reap the business benefits and is likely to result in wasted  time and budget, possibly leading to the failure of the change initiative.",679,106,169.75
292,"The standard  lifecycles and approaches are used in the main to develop software (or some stages are  used when procuring an off-the-shelf package) but we also need to consider them when  delivering the other required aspects – the business processes and procedures, and the  new jobs and people skills. In many situations we cannot deliver all of the requirements  as we would ideally, or even ultimately, desire. The nature of the business constraints  may mean that we have to explore alternative means of delivering some requirements  in the short, or even longer, term. The role for the business analyst is to identify where  this is required and seek out the options for delivery that will ensure the business needs  are met. 262",735,122,183.75

294,"14 DELIVERING THE BUSINESS SOLUTION Debra Paul and James Cadle INTRODUCTION This chapter considers the work of the business analyst following the initial problem  investigation and the definition of requirements. Although utilised mainly during the  early stages of the business change lifecycle, business analysis skills are also required  through to the delivery of the solution, and beyond, in order to support and enable the  successful implementation of the changes and the realisation of the benefits. STAGES OF THE BUSINESS CHANGE LIFECYCLE While business analysis is critical at the outset of a change project, there remains a lot  of work to be done as the project progresses through the business change lifecycle. This  may involve the engagement of stakeholders in order to ensure their continued buy-in,  and the detailed design, development and deployment of the new processes and systems.  To do this successfully requires a great deal of thought, preparation and planning – and  all of these activities are facilitated by the involvement of business analysts.",1074,165,268.5
294,There are five stages in the lifecycle introduced in Chapter 1 and reproduced in Figure  14.1. These stages represent the key areas of activity required to enable successful  business change for an organisation. Figure 14.1  The business change lifecycle Figure 14.1 264,270,42,67.5
295,"DELIVERING THE BUSINESS SOLUTION yy Alignment is concerned with ensuring the organisation’s objectives and strategy  are aligned with the external business world, and that any proposed changes  are aligned with the internal policies and architectures. This work is discussed  in Chapter 3, including the involvement of the business analyst. yy Definition is concerned with taking a closer look at a proposed business  situation in order to uncover root causes of problems, conduct a thorough  analysis, recommend relevant, feasible changes and define the requirements.  This stage is the topic of much of this book and is not explored further in this  chapter. However, the business analysts will have defined the business and  solution requirements by the conclusion of this stage.",782,119,195.5
295,"yy Design is concerned with the detailed specification, development and testing  of the solution, including the business processes and related tasks, and the  software that is needed to support them. yy Implementation is concerned with the planning and preparation for the  deployment of the business changes. yy Realisation is concerned with the review of the predicted business benefits with  a view to identifying those that have been achieved and taking further action to  support the achievement of those still to be realised. These stages are shown in the lifecycle as a sequence but this is not necessarily the  case as there may be an iterative approach taken requiring some stages to be revisited.  Therefore, it is preferable to consider the lifecycle as providing an overall direction for a  change project rather than enforcing a straight sequence of activities.",874,138,218.5
295,"BA ROLE IN THE BUSINESS CHANGE LIFECYCLE Business analysis helps organisations implement change successfully so it follows that  the role of the business analyst is relevant across the entire change lifecycle. The tools  and techniques described throughout this book are invaluable when working within a  change project. This is explored further below. Design stage The design stage encompasses several major tasks: the design of the solution, and  the development and testing of the software to support the solution. If the changes are  complex, there may be a need for extensive testing or piloting of the revised business  processes in order to ensure that they are robust and will deliver the required value.",712,112,178.0
295," The POPIT™ model, shown in Figure 14.2, was introduced in Chapter 8 as a useful aid  for gap analysis. However, it is also helpful to summarise the different elements to be  addressed when designing a solution. As can be seen in the POPIT model, there are four areas to be considered during the  design stage: the organisation, the processes, the people and the information and  technology. So, we cannot change the processes and systems without considering their  impact upon the organisation’s management structure and job roles or upon the skill  requirements of the staff. There may be a need to introduce a different structure because  of the merger of teams.",665,110,166.25

296,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Figure 14.2  The POPIT model Figure 14.2 have changed. Different performance measures may be required. The capability of the  teams may need to change in line with the new work practices. And all of this needs  to be thought through, not only in terms of what the change might be but also how the  change will be brought about.  People – skill development If there needs to be new capability offered by the team, the skills of the team members  will need to be identified and subject to a gap analysis.",520,93,130.0
296,"Having identified the required  skills, the means of achieving them will need to be designed; this may involve the design  and development of training events. Business analysts are often involved in capability  uplift, delivering the training and support to business users to enable them to conduct  their new work practices.  Organisation – structures, measures and jobs Where the revised processes have involved the merger or change of the team structure  this will need to be defined and the impact upon the management structure considered.  The changes to business processes typically involve the introduction of amended, if not  new, job roles, so these will also need to be defined. Again, the business analyst will be  able to produce these definitions.",760,119,190.0
296,"There may also be a need to reconsider performance  measures, such as CSFs and KPIs (see Chapter 3). Business process design The design of the ‘to be’ business processes was described in Chapter 7; this is a key  area of business analysis work and is a fundamental part of the business change  solution. However, there is a great deal of work to be done when a ‘to be’ process is  to be implemented and it is often the case that this detail is overlooked or postponed.  For example, there may be a need for detailed definition of the procedures and  documentation to be used in the new process; or, the communication channels may  need to be revised. All of this will need to be considered at an early stage in order to  ensure that the solution is well understood and ready for deployment.",790,143,197.5
296,266,3,1,0.75
297,"DELIVERING THE BUSINESS SOLUTION Information and technology Chapter 13 set out the lifecycles used to develop the software required to support the  business processes. While other chapters have discussed in detail the major aspects  of business analysis work such as requirements definition and management, it is also  worthwhile considering the BA role during the design, development and testing of the  software solution.  Design	 	 As the bridge between the business and the IT team, the  business analyst is required to ensure that the requirements  are understood and delivered. This may require them to  clarify what the software needs to do. The requirements  documentation provides the basis for the design of the software  solution.",742,112,185.5
297,"Therefore, the business analyst may be required to  support the design activity by clarifying any points, possibly  following consultation with the business users. Development	 It may also be the case that the development team has detailed  queries about the requirements, or that decisions about the  detailed software functionality need to be made; the business  analysts can help in communicating with the business staff  and supporting them in making decisions about the detailed  requirements. Given that the business analysts have an  overall understanding of the solution, they can also be of great  assistance during this discussion as they are able to assess  the impact of proposals across the solution, identifying where  there may be problems in adopting a particular approach and  suggesting alternatives. Testing		 Business analysts regularly support user acceptance testing.  Initially, the business analyst will have defined the acceptance  criteria that will be used to confirm a requirement has been  met.",1025,151,256.25
297,"These will be defined in the requirements catalogue  (see Chapter 11). Once the software has been developed and  tested by the IT team, the business analysts may support  the business staff during user acceptance testing. There are  various techniques that may be used to define test cases and  scenarios including:  yy Use case descriptions – these support a use case diagram  and show the system response to the occurrence of  an event. A main success scenario or ‘happy day’ is  documented as a series of steps plus any alternative  scenarios that may occur. yy Decision tables – these set out clearly the range of  conditions for a particular situation and the actions to  be taken given a specific set of conditions.",721,121,180.25
297,An example is  shown in Figure 14.3. 267,40,8,10.0
298,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS yy State charts (also known as state transition diagrams  and state machines) – these show the different states a  particular entity or class may take on during its lifetime  in the system.

299,"DELIVERING THE BUSINESS SOLUTION Implementation stage The implementation of a business change programme requires a great deal of planning  and any changes need to be executed with care. The major concern here is the emotional  impact experienced by the business staff during this stage. A failure to consider this  may inflame resistance and undermine the changes. In extreme cases, this may cause  the entire change programme to fail. The SARAH model in Figure 14.5 sets out the  emotional curve that may affect anyone experiencing the introduction of business  change.",570,89,142.5
299, Figure 14.5  The SARAH model Figu re 14.5 The SARAH model sets out five stages of the emotions experienced when someone is  faced with a change.  Shock	 	 The initial reaction to a change initiative is often shock. This  may be due to a lack of awareness of the need for change.  This may be particularly the case if most of the staff feel the  organisation is doing well. Anger	 	 Shock then moves to anger as people begin to understand what  the change may mean for them.,476,86,119.0
299,"This anger may be directed at  the senior managers who have initiated the change and also  at others – for example, the business analysts or developers –  who are involved in bringing it about. Rejection	 When someone feels angry about the change, the next stage  is to reject the ideas and direction. A sense of avoiding the  change can develop along with the desire to be left to continue  as normal.  Acceptance	 Eventually an acceptance of the change develops. This may not  mean that there is wholehearted support for the change but, as  a minimum, a sense that the change is definitely happening so  it is best to accept it.",632,110,158.0
299,269,3,1,0.75
300,"BUSINESS ANALYSIS Hope	 	 Ultimately, people begin to see the positive benefits brought  about by the change. Business analysts must recognise that these reactions to change are to be expected in  those affected by a business change programme. It is important that we are sensitive  to these reactions and try to help people move through the different emotional stages.  BAs can help support the business staff to cope with the business changes by providing  coaching, training and ongoing support. They may also be able to offer reassurance to  help the business staff gain confidence in using the new processes and systems.",626,100,156.5
300,"To do  this requires a high degree of interpersonal and stakeholder engagement skill during  the deployment of the changes. Realisation stage Benefits are only likely to be realised if they are defined well, planned for their delivery  and managed properly. However, it is often the case with change projects that a lot  of thought goes into planning the project to define, develop and deliver the solution  but less into how the expected business benefits are to be achieved. It is vital that a  comprehensive benefits plan is developed in addition to the business case so that the  benefits can be tracked and managed.  The benefits plan The benefits plan should include the following elements: Context/vision	 This sets out the background for the change project and  provides a wider business context for the benefits.",822,133,205.5
300,"Benefits profiles	 This is a full description of each of the benefits, including the  type of benefit and the identified benefit owner (see below).  Each benefit profile includes information such as the identifier  and name, the owner, any stakeholders involved or interested  in the benefits, relevant measures and dependencies.

The dependencies between the benefits and the  ultimate business objectives is also shown.  Responsibilities	 A list of the benefit owners and their responsibilities.",653,92,163.25
300,"Tracking procedures	 How the benefits will be tracked and reported upon. The benefit owner is a named individual who is tasked with ensuring that the benefit  is achieved. To discharge this role effectively, the person nominated must be in a  position to take the actions needed to secure the benefit, which implies that they are a  senior manager with responsibility for the area in which the benefit will be gained. For  instance, if the main benefit of a project is staff savings, then the benefit owner has  to be someone in a position to make these savings. Sometimes – and particularly in  270",599,103,149.75
301,"DELIVERING THE BUSINESS SOLUTION large organisations – benefit ownership has to be shared among a number of people  but this brings with it the problem of divided responsibility; some managers make  the required changes to secure the benefits, others do not and so the project is less  successful overall than it could have been. Benefits dependency network A benefits dependency network (or benefits map) is a diagrammatic representation of  what needs to be done on a project in order to achieve its expected benefits. It also sets  out how the benefits contribute towards the project’s ultimate (business) objectives.  An example of such a framework – for an organisation that wishes to raise its public  profile – is shown in Figure 14.6. Figure 14.6  Benefits dependency network (adapted from Ward and Daniels (2012)) Figure 14.6 Although the arrows run from left to right, a benefits dependency network is best created  right to left, starting with the overall business objectives that the change project is  designed to achieve.",1035,166,258.75
301,"We then work backwards to the set of benefits that will contribute  to those objectives. Next, we consider what business changes will be required to secure  those benefits. And finally we identify the enabling changes that will lead to the business  changes. The advantage of constructing a benefits dependency network such as that in  Figure 14.6 is that it forces us to consider all of the work that is required to achieve  the project’s business benefits, not just that related to IT systems development. As  the example in Figure 14.6 shows, only one ‘stream’ of enabling/business changes  represents the technical aspects of the project; the other ‘streams’ highlight the non-IT  changes that will be required if the overall benefits and objectives are to be achieved.",773,125,193.25
301,"The network also helps us to identify who should take responsibility for each stream.  The technical stream, relating to the website redevelopment, for instance, is obviously  the responsibility of the designated (IT) project manager whereas the stream relating  271",266,39,66.5

Managing the business case The business case needs to be managed throughout the business change lifecycle. The  central and ongoing nature of the business case is shown clearly in Figure 14.1. Each  time a request for change arises, it is important to review the business case to ensure  that it is still valid and to reflect the impact of the change. There may be an effect  upon several aspects of the business case, for example, the solution description, costs,  benefits and risks.",624,105,156.0
302,"It is also usual to review the business case at key points during the  business change lifecycle. This takes into account further detailed work that has taken  place up to a particular stage and may also require changes to the costs, benefits and  risks. If these changes are required the case for the investment must be checked to  ensure continuing viability. Benefits reviews Management processes are needed to ensure that the benefits are reviewed in two  circumstances: Scheduled reviews	 At each of the ‘decision gates’ in the project (see Figure 9.1 in  Chapter 9), the expected benefits should be examined as part  of the review. At each stage, careful consideration should be  given to whether the expected benefits are still available and  whether they are still sufficient to compensate for an increase  in the expected costs of the project.",853,139,213.25
302,"In the light of such a review,  it may be necessary to rework the financial case in order to  define the expected investment return or even re-scope the  project to improve the prospects of securing the maximum  business benefit. Unscheduled reviews	 These should be triggered whenever a significant event  occurs that could potentially affect the expected benefits.  Major requests for change are an obvious example of such a  situation as they could cause the project to cost more, take  longer or deliver something different, and all of these might  affect the benefits. Other significant events could include a  change in the key stakeholders (especially the project sponsor),  developments in the external business environment or a  change to the organisation’s business strategy. So, the business case should be reviewed frequently during the project in order  to check if the predicted benefits are still able to be achieved and to identify any  changes required to the project in order to enable those benefits to be delivered.",1036,164,259.0
302," The main evaluation, however, takes place after the project has finished and has  been in operation for a designated period of time. Consideration should be given to  the timescale required for the expected benefits to have materialised. Depending  on the type and scale of the project, this could happen months, or even years, after  272",339,55,84.75
303,"DELIVERING THE BUSINESS SOLUTION the project ends. The evaluation will also examine the progress being made towards  achieving the benefits and consider whether any further action needs to be taken to  enable the benefits to be achieved.  Benefits Realisation Report Ultimately a Benefits Realisation Report should be produced which assesses clearly  whether the hoped-for benefits have been gained or not.

303,"Where further changes are required to  deliver the benefits, the benefits plan should be updated and a further benefits review  should be scheduled. It is also possible that additional benefits are identified during  the benefits review; these are benefits that were not predicted in the business case but  may now be available as a result of the change project. The benefits review includes  a consideration and analysis of what needs to be done to deliver these additional  benefits. This will also result in changes to the benefits plan and scheduling of a further  benefits review.
